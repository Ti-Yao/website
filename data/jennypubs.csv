Here we propose a deep learning framework for “FReSCO” (Flow Reconstruction and Segmentation for low latency Cardiac Output monitoring). Methods: Deep artifact suppression and segmentation U-Nets were independently trained. Breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR data (N = 516) were synthetically undersampled using a variable-density spiral sampling pattern and gridded to create aliased data for training of the artifact suppression U-net. A subset of the data (N = 96) was segmented and used to train the segmentation U-net. Real-time spiral phase-contrast MR was prospectively acquired and then reconstructed and segmented using the trained models (FReSCO) at low latency at the scanner in 10 healthy subjects during rest, exercise, and recovery periods. Cardiac output obtained via FReSCO was compared with a reference rest CO and rest and exercise compressed-sensing CO. Results: The FReSCO framework was demonstrated prospectively at the scanner. Beat-to-beat heartrate, stroke volume, and CO could be visualized with a mean latency of 622 ms. No significant differences were noted when compared with reference at rest (bias = −0.21 ± 0.50 L/min, p = 0.246) or compressed sensing at peak exercise (bias = 0.12 ± 0.48 L/min, p = 0.458). Conclusions: The FReSCO framework was successfully demonstrated for real-time monitoring of CO during exercise and could provide a convenient tool for assessment of the hemodynamic response to a range of stressors. © 2022 The Authors.

We investigated exercise capacity in patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19 with and without self-reported exercise intolerance using magnetic resonance– augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty subjects were enrolled in this single-center prospective observational case-control study, split into 3 equally sized groups: 2 groups of age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched previously hospitalized patients following COVID-19 without clearly identifiable postviral complications and with either self-reported reduced (COVIDreduced ) or fully recovered (COVIDnormal ) exercise capacity; a group of age-and sex-matched healthy controls. The COVIDreduced group had the lowest peak workload (79W [Interquartile range (IQR), 65–100] versus controls 104W [IQR, 86–148]; P=0.01) and shortest exercise duration (13.3±2.8 minutes versus controls 16.6±3.5 minutes; P=0.008), with no differences in these parameters between COVIDnormal patients and controls. The COVIDreduced group had: (1) the lowest peak indexed oxygen uptake (14.9 mL/ minper kg [IQR, 13.1–16.2]) versus controls (22.3 mL/min per kg [IQR, 16.9– 27.6]; P=0.003) and COVIDnormal patients (19.1 mL/ min per kg [IQR, 15.4– 23.7]; P=0.04); (2) the lowest peak indexed cardiac output (4.7±1.2 L/min per m2) versus controls (6.0±1.2 L/min per m2; P=0.004) and COVIDnormal patients (5.7±1.5 L/min per m2; P=0.02), associated with lower indexed stroke volume (SVi:COVIDreduced 39±10 mL/min per m2 versus COVIDnormal 43±7 mL/min per m2 versus controls 48±10 mL/min per m2; P=0.02). There were no differences in peak tissue oxygen extraction or biventricular ejection fractions between groups. There were no associations between COVID-19 illness severity and peak magnetic resonance– augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing metrics. Peak indexed oxygen uptake, indexed cardiac output, and indexed stroke volume all correlated with duration from discharge to magnetic resonance– augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance– augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing suggests failure to augment stroke volume as a potential mechanism of exercise intolerance in previously hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This is unrelated to disease severity and, reassuringly, improves with time from acute illness. © 2022 The Authors.

This is made possible by modern MRI technology such as fast-switching gradients and parallel imaging. It is compatible with many (but not all) MRI sequences, including spoiled gradient echo, balanced steady-state free precession, and single-shot rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement. RT-MRI has earned an important role in both diagnostic imaging and image guidance of invasive procedures. Its unique diagnostic value is prominent in areas of the body that undergo substantial and often irregular motion, such as the heart, gastrointestinal system, upper airway vocal tract, and joints. Its value in interventional procedure guidance is prominent for procedures that require multiple forms of soft-tissue contrast, as well as flow information. In this review, we discuss the history of RT-MRI, fundamental tradeoffs, enabling technology, established applications, and current trends. Level of Evidence: 5.

However, problems with skeletal muscle oxygen extraction have not been fully investigated. This study used cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CMR-CPET) to simultaneously measure oxygen consumption and cardiac output. This allowed calculation of arteriovenous oxygen content gradient, a recognized marker of oxygen extraction. We performed CMR-CPET in 4 groups: systemic sclerosis (SSc); systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc-PAH); non-connective tissue disease pulmonary hypertension (NC-PAH); and healthy controls. Methods: We performed CMR-CPET in 60 subjects (15 in each group) using a supine ergometer following a ramped exercise protocol until exhaustion. Values for oxygen consumption, cardiac output and oxygen content gradient, as well as ventricular volumes, were obtained at rest and peak-exercise for all subjects. In addition, T1 and T2 maps were acquired at rest, and the most recent clinical measures (hemoglobin, lung function, 6-min walk, cardiac and catheterization) were collected. Results: All patient groups had reduced peak oxygen consumption compared to healthy controls (p < 0.022). The SSc and SSc-PAH groups had reduced peak oxygen content gradient compared to healthy controls (p < 0.03). Conversely, the SSc-PAH and NC-PH patients had reduced peak cardiac output compared to healthy controls and SSc patients (p < 0.006). Higher hemoglobin was associated with higher peak oxygen content gradient (p = 0.025) and higher myocardial T1 was associated with lower peak stroke volume (p = 0.011). Conclusions: Reduced peak oxygen consumption in SSc patients is predominantly driven by reduced oxygen content gradient and in SSc-PAH patients this was amplified by reduced peak cardiac output.

Target spatial and temporal resolutions require high acceleration rates often leading to long reconstruction times. Here we propose a deep artifact suppression framework for fast and accurate flow quantification. Methods: U-Nets were trained for deep artifact suppression using 520 breath-hold gated spiral PCMR aortic datasets collected in congenital heart disease patients. Two spiral trajectories (uniform and perturbed) and two losses (Mean Absolute Error -MAE- and average structural similarity index measurement -SSIM-) were compared in synthetic data in terms of MAE, peak SNR (PSNR) and SSIM. Perturbed spiral PCMR was prospectively acquired in 20 patients. Stroke Volume (SV), peak mean velocity and edge sharpness measurements were compared to Compressed Sensing (CS) and Cartesian reference. Results: In synthetic data, perturbed spiral consistently outperformed uniform spiral for the different image metrics. U-Net MAE showed better MAE and PSNR while U-Net SSIM showed higher SSIM based metrics. In-vivo, there were no significant differences in SV between any of the real-time reconstructions and the reference standard Cartesian data. However, U-Net SSIM had better image sharpness and lower biases for peak velocity when compared to U-Net MAE. Reconstruction of 96 frames took ~59 s for CS and 3.9 s for U-Nets. Conclusion: Deep artifact suppression of complex valued images using an SSIM based loss was successfully demonstrated in a cohort of congenital heart disease patients for fast and accurate flow quantification. © 2021","Cardiac MRI; Congenital heart disease; Flow imaging; Image reconstruction; Machine learning; Real time","Article; artifact reduction; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; compressed sensing; congenital heart disease; edge sharpness; heart stroke volume; human; image artifact; image reconstruction; peak mean velocity; phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance; physical parameters; prospective study; retrospective study; school child; signal noise ratio; artifact; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; heart; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phase contrast microscopy; Artifacts; Heart; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Microscopy, Phase-Contrast",,,,"Siemens Healthineers, Germany","Firmin, D.N., Nayler, G.L., Klipstein, R.H., Underwood, S.R., Rees, R.S., Longmore, D.B., In vivo validation of MR velocity imaging (1987) J Comput Assist Tomogr, 11, pp. 751-756; Gatehouse, P.D., Firmin, D.N., Collins, S., Longmore, D.B., Real time blood flow imaging by spiral scan phase velocity mapping (1994) Magn Reson Med, 31, pp. 504-512; Steeden, J.A., Atkinson, D., Hansen, M.S., Taylor, A.M., Muthurangu, V., Rapid flow assessment of congenital heart disease with high-spatiotemporal- resolution gated spiral phase-contrast MR imaging (2011) Radiology, 260, pp. 79-87; Kowalik, G.T., Knight, D., Steeden, J.A., Muthurangu, V., Perturbed spiral real-time phase-contrast MR with compressive sensing reconstruction for assessment of flow in children (2020) Magn Reson Med, 83, pp. 2077-2091; Lustig, M., Donoho, D., Pauly, J.M., Sparse MRI: the application of compressed sensing for rapid MR imaging (2007) Magn Reson Med, 58, pp. 1182-1195; Haji-Valizadeh, H., Feng, L., Ma, L.E., Shen, D., Block, K.T., Robinson, J.D., Highly accelerated, real-time phase-contrast MRI using radial k-space sampling and GROG-GRASP reconstruction: a feasibility study in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (2020) NMR Biomed, 33; Bustin, A., Fuin, N., Botnar, R.M., Prieto, C., From compressed-sensing to artificial intelligence-based cardiac MRI reconstruction (2020) Front Cardiovasc Med, 7, p. 17; Hauptmann, A., Arridge, S., Lucka, F., Muthurangu, V., Steeden, J.A., Real-time cardiovascular MR with spatio-temporal artifact suppression using deep learning–proof of concept in congenital heart disease (2019) Magn Reson Med, 81, pp. 1143-1156; Schlemper, J., Caballero, J., Hajnal, J.V., Price, A.N., Rueckert, D., A deep cascade of convolutional neural networks for dynamic MR image reconstruction (2018) IEEE Trans Med Imaging, 37, pp. 491-503; Hammernik, K., Klatzer, T., Kobler, E., Recht, M.P., Sodickson, D.K., Pock, T., Learning a variational network for reconstruction of accelerated MRI data (2018) Magn Reson Med, 79, pp. 3055-3071; Haji-Valizadeh, H., Guo, R., Kucukseymen, S., Paskavitz, A., Cai, X., Rodriguez, J., Highly accelerated free-breathing real-time phase contrast cardiovascular MRI via complex-difference deep learning (2021) Magn Reson Med, , 00:mrm.28750; Ronneberger, O., Fischer, P., Brox, T., U-net: Convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation (2015) Lect.

Real-time acquisitions often require iterative image reconstruction strategies, which lead to long reconstruction times. In this study, we aim to reconstruct highly undersampled radial real-time data with low latency using deep learning. Methods: A 2D U-Net with convolutional long short-term memory layers is proposed to exploit spatial and preceding temporal information to reconstruct highly accelerated tiny golden radial data with low latency. The network was trained using a dataset of breath-hold CINE data (including 770 time series from 7 different orientations). Synthetic paired data were created by retrospectively undersampling the magnitude images, and the network was trained to recover the target images. In the spirit of interventional imaging, the network was trained and tested for varying acceleration rates and orientations. Data were prospectively acquired and reconstructed in real time in 1 healthy subject interactively and in 3 patients who underwent catheterization. Images were visually compared to sliding window and compressed sensing reconstructions and a conventional Cartesian real-time sequence. Results: The proposed network generalized well to different acceleration rates and unseen orientations for all considered metrics in simulated data (less than 4% reduction in structural similarity index compared to similar acceleration and orientation-specific networks). The proposed reconstruction was demonstrated interactively, successfully depicting catheters in vivo with low latency (39 ms, including 19 ms for deep artifact suppression) and an image quality comparing favorably to other reconstructions. Conclusion: Deep artifact suppression was successfully demonstrated in the time-critical application of non-Cartesian real-time interventional cardiac MR. © 2021 The Authors.

However, gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) carry a risk of dose-related adverse effects. Purpose: To develop a deep learning method to reduce GBCA dose by 80%. Study Type: Retrospective and prospective. Population: A total of 1157 retrospective and 40 prospective congenital heart disease patients for training/validation and testing, respectively. Field Strength/Sequence: A 1.5 T, T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo. Assessment: A neural network was trained to enhance low-dose (LD) 3D MRA using retrospective synthetic data and tested with prospective LD data. Image quality for LD (LD-MRA), enhanced LD (ELD-MRA), and high-dose (HD-MRA) was assessed in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and a quantitative measure of edge sharpness and scored for perceptual sharpness and contrast on a 1–5 scale. Diagnostic confidence was assessed on a 1–3 scale. LD- and ELD-MRA were assessed against HD-MRA for sensitivity/specificity and agreement of vessel diameter measurements (aorta and pulmonary arteries). Statistical Tests: SNR, CNR, edge sharpness, and vessel diameters were compared between LD-, ELD-, and HD-MRA using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance with post-hoc t-tests. Perceptual quality and diagnostic confidence were compared using Friedman's test with post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Sensitivity/specificity was compared using McNemar's test. Agreement of vessel diameters was assessed using Bland–Altman analysis. Results: SNR, CNR, edge sharpness, perceptual sharpness, and perceptual contrast were lower (P &lt; 0.05) for LD-MRA compared to ELD-MRA and HD-MRA. SNR, CNR, edge sharpness, and perceptual contrast were comparable between ELD and HD-MRA, but perceptual sharpness was significantly lower. Sensitivity/specificity was 0.824/0.921 for LD-MRA and 0.882/0.960 for ELD-MRA. Diagnostic confidence was 2.72, 2.85, and 2.92 for LD, ELD, and HD-MRA, respectively (PLD-ELD, PLD-HD &lt; 0.05). Vessel diameter measurements were comparable, with biases of 0.238 (LD-MRA) and 0.278 mm (ELD-MRA). Data Conclusion: Deep learning can improve contrast in LD cardiovascular MRA. Level of Evidence Level: 2. Technical Efficacy: Stage 2. © 2021 The Authors.

However, it is an inherently slow imaging technique. Over the last 20 years, parallel imaging, temporal encoding and compressed sensing have enabled substantial speed-ups in the acquisition of MRI data, by accurately recovering missing lines of k-space data. However, clinical uptake of vastly accelerated acquisitions has been limited, in particular in compressed sensing, due to the time-consuming nature of the reconstructions and unnatural looking images. Following the success of machine learning in a wide range of imaging tasks, there has been a recent explosion in the use of machine learning in the field of MRI image reconstruction. A wide range of approaches have been proposed, which can be applied in k-space and/or image-space. Promising results have been demonstrated from a range of methods, enabling natural looking images and rapid computation.

In this work, a free-breathing 3D whole-heart cine imaging framework was developed using a time-efficient stack of spirals trajectory and accelerated reconstruction. Two suitable view ordering methods are considered with different spacing between k-space readouts in the partition dimension: uniform and tiny golden ratio based. A simulation study suggested the latter did not present any benefits in terms of similarity to the true image. The proposed method was subsequently tested on 10 prospective subjects and compared with conventional multi-slice breath-hold imaging. Image quality was evaluated using objective and subjective scores and ventricular measurements were compared to assess clinical accuracy. Image quality was lower in the proposed technique than in breath-hold images but good agreement was found in clinically relevant ventricular measurements. In addition, the proposed method was fast to acquire, required minimal planning and provided full anatomical coverage with isotropic resolution. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cine imaging; CMR; Compressed sensing; Stack of spirals","adult; article; breath holding; clinical article; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; heart; human; human experiment; image quality; male; simulation; cine magnetic resonance imaging; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; heart; procedures; prospective study; reproducibility; three-dimensional imaging; Adult; Breath Holding; Computer Simulation; Female; Heart; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results",,,,,"Judd, R.M., Cardiac cine imaging (2015) Basic princ. cardiovasc.

However, they have long acquisition times. Here, we propose significant speed-ups using a deep-learning single volume super-resolution reconstruction, to recover high-resolution features from rapidly acquired low-resolution WH-bSSFP images. Methods: A 3D residual U-Net was trained using synthetic data, created from a library of 500 high-resolution WH-bSSFP images by simulating 50% slice resolution and 50% phase resolution. The trained network was validated with 25 synthetic test data sets. Additionally, prospective low-resolution data and high-resolution data were acquired in 40 patients. In the prospective data, vessel diameters, quantitative and qualitative image quality, and diagnostic scoring was compared between the low-resolution, super-resolution and reference high-resolution WH-bSSFP data. Results: The synthetic test data showed a significant increase in image quality of the low-resolution images after super-resolution reconstruction. Prospectively acquired low-resolution data was acquired ~× 3 faster than the prospective high-resolution data (173 s vs 488 s). Super-resolution reconstruction of the low-resolution data took < 1 s per volume. Qualitative image scores showed super-resolved images had better edge sharpness, fewer residual artefacts and less image distortion than low-resolution images, with similar scores to high-resolution data. Quantitative image scores showed super-resolved images had significantly better edge sharpness than low-resolution or high-resolution images, with significantly better signal-to-noise ratio than high-resolution data. Vessel diameters measurements showed over-estimation in the low-resolution measurements, compared to the high-resolution data. No significant differences and no bias was found in the super-resolution measurements in any of the great vessels. However, a small but significant for the underestimation was found in the proximal left coronary artery diameter measurement from super-resolution data. Diagnostic scoring showed that although super-resolution did not improve accuracy of diagnosis, it did improve diagnostic confidence compared to low-resolution imaging. Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the potential of using a residual U-Net for super-resolution reconstruction of rapidly acquired low-resolution whole heart bSSFP data within a clinical setting. We were able to train the network using synthetic training data from retrospective high-resolution whole heart data. The resulting network can be applied very quickly, making these techniques particularly appealing within busy clinical workflow. Thus, we believe that this technique may help speed up whole heart CMR in clinical practice. © 2020 The Author(s).","Convolutional neural network; Machine learning; Rapid imaging; Super-resolution; Whole-heart imaging","adult; artery diameter; article; artifact; clinical article; clinical practice; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; great blood vessel; human; image quality; left coronary artery; male; prospective study; signal noise ratio; steady state; velocity; workflow; adolescent; aged; child; computer assisted diagnosis; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; heart; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; predictive value; preschool child; reproducibility; time factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Deep Learning; Female; Heart; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Workflow; Young Adult",,,,,"Greil, G., Tandon, A., Silva Vieira, M., Hussain, T., 3D whole heart imaging for congenital heart disease (2017) Front Pediatr, 5, p. 36. , 28289674 5327357; Barkauskas, K.J., Rajiah, P., Ashwath, R., Hamilton, J.I., Chen, Y., Ma, D., Quantification of left ventricular functional parameter values using 3D spiral bSSFP and through-time Non-Cartesian GRAPPA (2014) J Cardiovasc Magn Reson, 16 (1), p. 65. , 25231607 4160541; Stehning, C., Börnert, P., Nehrke, K., Eggers, H., Stuber, M., Free-breathing whole-heart coronary MRA with 3D radial SSFP and self-navigated image reconstruction (2005) MRM, 54 (2), pp. 476-480. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2MzotlWjtg%3D%3D 16032682; Akçakaya, M., Basha, T.A., Goddu, B., Goepfert, L.A., Kissinger, K.V., Tarokh, V., Low-dimensional-structure self-learning and thresholding: Regularization beyond compressed sensing for MRI reconstruction (2011) MRM, 66 (3), pp. 756-767. , 21465542; Nam, S., Akçakaya, M., Basha, T., Stehning, C., Manning, W.J., Tarokh, V., Compressed sensing reconstruction for whole-heart imaging with 3D radial trajectories: A graphics processing unit implementation (2013) Magn Reson Med, 69 (1), pp. 91-102. , 22392604; Lu, Y., Yang, R., Zhang, J., Zhang, C., Super resolution image reconstruction in parallel magnetic resonance imaging (2010) IEEE ICCA 2010, , 9-11 June 2010; Tang, Y., Yan, P., Yuan, Y., Li, X., Single-image super-resolution via local learning (2011) Int J Mach Learn Cybern, 2 (1), pp. 15-23; Shi, W., Caballero, J., Ledig, C., Zhuang, X., Bai, W., Bhatia, K., (2013) Cardiac Image Super-resolution with Global Correspondence Using Multi-atlas Patchmatch, , (eds) et al.

A commonly used uniform density spiral and a new ‘perturbed’ spiral that produces more incoherent aliases were assessed. The aim was to ascertain whether greater incoherence enabled more accurate Compressive Sensing reconstruction and superior measurement of flow and velocity. Methods: A range of ‘perturbed’ spiral trajectories based on a uniform spiral trajectory were formulated. The trajectory that produced the most noise-like aliases was selected for further testing. For in-silico and in-vivo experiments, data was reconstructed using total Variation L1 regularisation in the spatial and temporal domains. In-silico, the reconstruction accuracy of the ‘perturbed’ golden spiral was compared to uniform density golden-angle spiral. For the in-vivo experiment, stroke volume and peak mean velocity were measured in 20 children using ‘perturbed’ and uniform density golden-angle spiral sequences. These were compared to a reference standard gated Cartesian sequence. Results: In-silico, the perturbed spiral acquisition produced more accurate reconstructions with less temporal blurring (NRMSE ranging from 0.03 to 0.05) than the uniform density acquisition (NRMSE ranging from 0.06 to 0.12). This translated in more accurate results in-vivo with no significant bias in the peak mean velocity (bias: −0.1, limits: −4.4 to 4.1 cm/s; P = 0.98) or stroke volume (bias: −1.8, limits: −9.4 to 5.8 ml, P = 0.19). Conclusion: We showed that a ‘perturbed’ golden-angle spiral approach is better suited to Compressive Sensing reconstruction due to more incoherent aliases. This enabled accurate real-time measurement of flow and peak velocity in children. © 2019 The Authors.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to better characterize both cardiac and vascular phenotype in children with hypertension. Objective: To use MRI to determine the cardiac and vascular phenotypes of different forms of treated hypertension and compare the results with those of healthy children. Materials and methods: Sixty children (15 with chronic renal disease with hypertension, 15 with renovascular hypertension, 15 with essential hypertension and 15 healthy subjects) underwent MRI with noninvasive blood pressure measurements. Cardiovascular parameters measured include systemic vascular resistance, total arterial compliance, left ventricular mass and volumetric data, ejection fraction and myocardial velocity. Between-group comparisons were used to investigate differences in the hypertension types. Results: Renal hypertension was associated with elevated vascular resistance (P≤0.007) and normal arterial compliance. Conversely, children with essential hypertension had normal resistance but increased compliance (P=0.001). Renovascular hypertension was associated with both increased resistance and compliance (P≤0.03). There was no difference in ventricular volumes, mass or cardiac output between groups. Children with renal hypertension also had lower systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Conclusion: Cardiovascular MRI may identify distinct vascular and cardiac phenotypes in different forms of treated childhood hypertension. Future studies are needed to investigate how this may inform further optimisation of blood pressure treatment in different types of hypertension. © 2019, The Author(s).","Aortic stiffness; Child; Chronic kidney disease;

Background: Cardiac involvement in light chain and transthyretin amyloidosis is the main driver of prognosis and influences treatment strategies. Numerous measures of cardiac structure and function are assessed by multiple imaging modalities in amyloidosis. Methods: A total f 322 subjects (311 systemic amyloidosis and 11 transthyretin gene mutation carriers) underwent comprehensive CMR and transthoracic echocardiography. The probabilities of 11 commonly measured structural and functional cardiac parameters being abnormal with increasing cardiac amyloidosis burden were evaluated. Cardiac amyloidosis burden was quantified using CMR-derived extracellular volume. The prognostic capacities of these parameters to predict death in amyloidosis were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Left ventricular mass and mitral annular plane systolic excursion by CMR along with strain and E/e’ by echocardiography have high probabilities of being abnormal at low cardiac amyloid burden. Reductions in biventricular ejection fractions and elevations in biatrial areas occur at high burdens of infiltration. The probabilities of indexed stroke volume, myocardial contraction fraction, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) being abnormal occur more gradually with increasing extracellular volume. Ninety patients (28%) died during a median follow-up of 22 months (interquartile range: 10 to 38 months). Univariable analysis showed that all imaging markers studied significantly predicted outcome. Multivariable analysis showed that TAPSE (hazard ratio: 1.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.85; p < 0.01) and indexed stroke volume (hazard ratio: 1.24; 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.48; p < 0.05) by CMR were the only independent predictors of mortality.

However, previous studies have not demonstrated a consistent relationship between shape and vascular load. In this study, 3D aortic shape was evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA), allowing investigation of the relationship between 3D shape and haemodynamics. Methods: Sixty subjects (38 male, 25.0 ± 7.8 years) with repaired coarctation were recruited. Central aortic haemodynamics including wave intensity analysis were measured noninvasively using a combination of blood pressure and phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). 3D curvature and radius data were derived from CMR angiograms. PCA was separately performed on 3D radius and curvature data to assess the role of arch geometry on haemodynamics. Clinical findings were corroborated using 1D vascular models. Results: There were no independent associations between 3D curvature and any hemodynamic parameters. However, the magnitude of the backwards compression wave was related to the 1st (r = - 0.36, p = 0.005), 3rd (r = 0.27, p = 0.036) and 4th (r = - 0.31, p = 0.017) principle components of radius. The 4th principle componentof radius also correlated with central aortic systolic pressure. These aortas had larger aortic roots, more transverse arch hypoplasia and narrower aortic isthmuses. Conclusions: There are major modes of variation in 3D aortic shape after coarctation repair witha modest association between variation in aortic radius and pathological wave reflections, but not with 3D curvature. Taken together, these data suggest that shape is not the major determinant of vascular load following coarctation repair, and calibre is more important than curvature. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Coarctation of the aorta; Congenital heart disease; Hemodynamics; Hypertension","adult; angiography; aortic coarctation; aortic reconstruction; aortic root; aortic systolic pressure; arterial hemodynamics; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; female; hemodynamics; human; hypoplasia; major clinical study; male; non invasive procedure; priority journal; systolic blood pressure; adolescent; aortic coarctation; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; magnetic resonance angiography; pathophysiology; predictive value; principal component analysis; reproducibility; retrospective study; thoracic aorta; treatment outcome; young adult; contrast medium; gadoterate meglumine; meglumine; organometallic compound; Adolescent; Adult; Aorta, Thoracic; Aortic Coarctation; Contrast Media; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Meglumine; Organometallic Compounds; Predictive Value of Tests; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",,"gadoterate meglumine, 92943-93-6; meglumine, 35564-86-4, 6284-40-8; Contrast Media; gadoterate meglumine; Meglumine; Organometallic Compounds","Avanto, Siemens Healthcare, Germany","Siemens Healthcare, Germany","Quail, M.A., Short, R., Pandya, B., Steeden, J.A., Khushnood, A., Taylor, A.M., Segers, P., Muthurangu, V., Abnormal wave reflections and left ventricular hypertrophy late after Coarctation of the aorta repair (2017) Hypertension, 69, pp. 501-509; O'Sullivan, J.J., Derrick, G., Darnell, R., Prevalence of hypertension in children after early repair of coarctation of the aorta: A cohort study using casual and 24 hour blood pressure measurement (2002) Heart, 88, pp. 163-166; De Divitiis, M., Pilla, C., Kattenhorn, M., Zadinello, M., Donald, A., Leeson, P., Wallace, S., Deanfield, J.E., Vascular dysfunction after repair of coarctation of the aorta: Impact of early surgery (2001) Circulation, 104, pp. I165-I170; Ou, P., Celermajer, D.S., Raisky, O., Jolivet, O., Buyens, F., Herment, A., Sidi, D., Mousseaux, E., Angular (gothic) aortic arch leads to enhanced systolic wave reflection, central aortic stiffness, and increased left ventricular mass late after aortic coarctation repair: Evaluation with magnetic resonance flow mapping (2008) J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 135, pp. 62-68; Ou, P., Mousseaux, E., Celermajer, D.S., Pedroni, E., Vouhe, P., Sidi, D., Bonnet, D., Aortic arch shape deformation after coarctation surgery: Effect on blood pressure response (2006) J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 132, pp. 1105-1111; Ntsinjana, H.N., Biglino, G., Capelli, C., Tann, O., Giardini, A., Derrick, G., Schievano, S., Taylor, A.M., Aortic arch shape is not associated with hypertensive response to exercise in patients with repaired congenital heart diseases (2013) J Cardiovasc Magn Reson, 15, p. 101; Bruse, J.L., McLeod, K., Biglino, G., Ntsinjana, H.N., Capelli, C., Hsia, T.Y., Sermesant, M., Schievano, S., Modeling of congenital hearts Alliance collaborative G: A statistical shape modelling framework to extract 3D shape biomarkers from medical imaging data: Assessing arch morphology of repaired coarctation of the aorta (2016) BMC Med Imaging, 16, p. 40; Bruse, J.L., Khushnood, A., McLeod, K., Biglino, G., Sermesant, M., Pennec, X., Taylor, A.M., Taylor, A.M., How successful is successful?

Residual convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown potential for removing artifacts caused by data undersampling. In this study, we investigated the ability of CNNs to reconstruct highly accelerated radial real-time data in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods: A 3D (2D plus time) CNN architecture was developed and trained using synthetic training data created from previously acquired breath hold cine images from 250 CHD patients. The trained CNN was then used to reconstruct actual real-time, tiny golden angle (tGA) radial SSFP data (13 × undersampled) acquired in 10 new patients with CHD. The same real-time data was also reconstructed with compressed sensing (CS) to compare image quality and reconstruction time. Ventricular volume measurements made using both the CNN and CS reconstructed images were compared to reference standard breath hold data. Results: It was feasible to train a CNN to remove artifact from highly undersampled radial real-time data. The overall reconstruction time with the CNN (including creation of aliased images) was shown to be >5 × faster than the CS reconstruction. In addition, the image quality and accuracy of biventricular volumes measured from the CNN reconstructed images were superior to the CS reconstructions. Conclusion: This article has demonstrated the potential for the use of a CNN for reconstruction of real-time radial data within the clinical setting. Clinical measures of ventricular volumes using real-time data with CNN reconstruction are not statistically significantly different from gold-standard, cardiac-gated, breath-hold techniques. © 2018 The Authors Magnetic Resonance in Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","convolutional neural network;

The aim was to demonstrate that GRASS acquisitions could be flexibly reconstructed as both cardiac-gated and time-resolved angiograms. Methods: Image quality of time-resolved and cardiac-gated reconstructions of the GRASS sequence were compared to 3 conventional stack of spirals (SoS) acquisitions in an in silico model. In 10 patients, the GRASS sequence was compared to conventional breath hold angiography (BH-MRA) in terms of image quality and for vessel measurement. Vessel measurements were also compared to cine images. Results: In the cardiac-gated in silico model, the image quality of GRASS was superior to regular and golden-angle with regular step SoS approaches. In the time-resolved model, GRASS image quality was comparable to the golden-angle with regular step technique and superior to regular SoS acquisitions. In patients, there was no difference in qualitative image scores between GRASS and BH-MRA, but SNR was lower. There was good agreement in vessel measurements between the GRASS reconstructions and conventional MR techniques (BH-MRA: 29.8 ± 5.6 mm, time-resolved GRASS-MRA: 29.9 ± 5.4 mm, SSFP diastolic: 29.4 ± 5.8 mm, cardiac-gated GRASS-MRA diastolic: 29.5 ± 5.5 mm, P > 0.87). Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the GRASS acquisition enables flexible reconstruction of the same raw data as both time-resolved and cardiac-gated volumes. This may enable better interrogation of anatomy in congenital heart disease. © 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","cardiac MRA; compressive sensing; free breathing; golden ratio","Cardiology;

The requirement for high spatiotemporal resolution in children necessitates the use of highly accelerated imaging techniques. Methods: A novel real-time balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) spiral sequence reconstructed using Compressed Sensing (CS) was prospectively validated against the breath-hold clinical standard for assessment of ventricular volumes in 60 children with congenital heart disease. Qualitative image scoring, quantitative image quality, as well as evaluation of biventricular volumes was performed. Standard BH and real-time measures were compared using the paired t-test and agreement for volumetric measures were evaluated using Bland Altman analysis. Results: Acquisition time for the entire short axis stack (∼ 13 slices) using the spiral real-time technique was ∼ 20 s, compared to ∼ 348 s for the standard breath hold technique. Qualitative scores reflected more residual aliasing artefact (p < 0.001) and lower edge definition (p < 0.001) in spiral real-time images than standard breath hold images, with lower quantitative edge sharpness and estimates of image contrast (p < 0.001). There was a small but statistically significant (p < 0.05) overestimation of left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume (1.0 ± 3.5 mL), and underestimation of LV end-diastolic volume (- 1.7 ± 4.6 mL), LV stroke volume (- 2.6 ± 4.8 mL) and LV ejection fraction (- 1.5 ± 3.0%) using the real-time technique. We also observed a small underestimation of right ventricular stroke volume (- 1.8 ± 4.9 mL) and ejection fraction (- 1.4 ± 3.7%) using the real-time imaging technique. No difference in inter-observer or intra-observer variability were observed between the BH and real-time sequences. Conclusions: Real-time bSSFP imaging using spiral trajectories combined with a compressed sensing reconstruction showed good agreement for quantification of biventricular metrics in children with heart disease, despite slightly lower image quality. This technique holds the potential for free breathing data acquisition, with significantly shorter scan times in children. © 2018 The Author(s).","Children; Compressed sensing; Congenital heart disease;

Recently, we were able to show arterial stiffness, measured by invasive pulse wave velocity (IPWV), seems to be an excellent predictor for blood pressure response. However, given the invasiveness, IPWV is less suitable as a selection criterion for patients undergoing RDN. Consequently, we aimed to investigate the value of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) based measures of arterial stiffness in predicting the outcome of RDN compared to IPWV as reference. Methods: Patients underwent CMR prior to RDN to assess ascending aortic distensibility (AAD), total arterial compliance (TAC), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). In a second step, central aortic blood pressure was estimated from ascending aortic area change and flow sequences and used to re-calculate total arterial compliance (cTAC). Additionally, IPWV was acquired. Results: Thirty-two patients (24 responders and 8 non-responders) were available for analysis. AAD, TAC and cTAC were higher in responders, IPWV was higher in non-responders. SVR was not different between the groups. Patients with AAD, cTAC or TAC above median and IPWV below median had significantly better BP response. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves predicting blood pressure response for IPWV, AAD, cTAC and TAC revealed areas under the curve of 0.849, 0.828, 0.776 and 0.753 (p = 0.004, 0.006, 0.021 and 0.035). Conclusions: Beyond IPWV, AAD, cTAC and TAC appear as useful outcome predictors for RDN in patients with hypertension. CMR-derived markers of arterial stiffness might serve as non-invasive selection criteria for RDN. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aortic distensibility; Arterial stiffness;

Our aim was to investigate the feasibility and utility of estimating 99mTc-DPD uptake in myocardial tissue; this has the potential to yield reliable quantitative information on cardiac amyloid burden, which is urgently required to monitor disease progression and response to novel treatments. Methods: Three methods of quantitation were developed and tested on 74 patients with proven cardiac ATTR amyloidosis who had recently undergone 99mTc-DPD planar whole-body imaging and SPECT-CT. Quantitative results were compared to measurements of extracellular volume fraction (ECV) by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, a validated technique for measuring amyloid burden. Results: An experienced clinician graded uptake using a widely-used visual scoring system as 1 (n = 15), 2 (n = 39) or 3 (n = 20). Linear correlations between the SPECT and ECV data (p &lt;.001) were demonstrated. None of the methods showed that 99mTc-DPD uptake in the heart was significantly greater in patients with grade-3 uptake than in those with grade-2 uptake. Conclusions: Quantitation of 99mTc-DPD uptake in cardiac transthyretin amyloid deposits is complex and is hindered by competition for radiotracer with amyloid in skeletal muscle. The latter underlies differences in uptake between grade-2 and grade-3 patients, not cardiac uptake. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","amyloidosis; ATTR; cardiology; DPD; quantitation; SPECT","butedronate technetium tc 99m; transthyretin; technetium complex; transthyretin; Article; ATTR amyloidosis; cardiac imaging; cardiac muscle; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; drug uptake; heart amyloidosis; human; major clinical study; priority journal; scoring system; single photon emission computed tomography; whole body imaging; amyloidosis; cardiomyopathy; genetics; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Amyloidosis; Cardiomyopathies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Organotechnetium Compounds; Prealbumin; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",,"Organotechnetium Compounds; Prealbumin","teceos, CIS, France","CIS, France","Lachmann, H.J., Hawkins, P.N., Systemic amyloidosis (2006) Curr Opin Pharmacol, 6, pp. 214-220; Sipe, J.D., Benson, M.D., Buxbaum, J.D., Amyloid fibril proteins and amyloidosis: chemical identification and clinical classification.

Identifying high-risk children who may benefit from further therapeutic intervention is difficult as cardiovascular abnormalities are subtle. Although transthoracic echocardiography may be used to detect sub-clinical abnormalities, it has well-known problems with reproducibility that limit its ability to accurately detect these changes. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the reference standard method for assessing blood flow, cardiac structure and function. Furthermore, recent innovations enable the assessment of radial and longitudinal myocardial velocity, such that detection of sub-clinical changes is now possible. Thus, CMR may be ideal for cardiovascular assessment in pediatric CKD. This study aims to comprehensively assess cardiovascular function in pediatric CKD using CMR and determine its relationship with CKD severity. Methods: A total of 120 children (40 mild, 40 moderate, 20 severe pre-dialysis CKD subjects and 20 healthy controls) underwent CMR with non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurements. Cardiovascular parameters measured included systemic vascular resistance (SVR), total arterial compliance (TAC), left ventricular (LV) structure, ejection fraction (EF), cardiac timings, radial and longitudinal systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Between group comparisons and regression modelling were used to identify abnormalities in CKD and determine the effects of renal severity on myocardial function. Results: The elevation in mean BP in CKD was accompanied by significantly increased afterload (SVR), without evidence of arterial stiffness (TAC) or increased fluid overload. Left ventricular volumes and global function were not abnormal in CKD. However, there was evidence of LV remodelling, prolongation of isovolumic relaxation time and reduced systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Conclusion: Abnormal cardiovascular function is evident in pre-dialysis pediatric CKD. Novel CMR biomarkers may be useful for the detection of subtle abnormalities in this population. Further studies are needed to determine to prognostic value of these biomarkers. © 2018 The Author(s).","Arterial stiffness; Chronic renal failure; Hypertension; Myocardial impairment; Pediatrics; Systemic vascular resistance","biological marker;

Current methodologies require laboratory blood hematocrit (Hct) measurement – which complicates the technique. The attenuation of blood (HUblood) is known to change with anemia. We hypothesized that the relationship between Hct and HUblood could be calibrated to rapidly generate a synthetic ECV without formally measuring Hct. Methods The association between Hct and HUblood was derived from forty non-contrast thoracic CT scans using regression analysis. Synthetic Hct was then used to calculate synthetic ECV, and in turn compared with ECV using blood Hct in a validation cohort with mild interstitial expansion due to fibrosis (aortic stenosis, n = 28, ECVCT = 28 ± 4%) and severe interstitial expansion due to amyloidosis (n = 27; ECVCT = 54 ± 11%, p &lt; 0.001). For histological validation, synthetic ECV was correlated with collagen volume fraction (CVF) in a separate cohort with aortic stenosis (n = 18). All CT scans were performed at 120 kV and 160 mAs. Results HUblood was a good predictor of Hct (R2 = 0.47; p &lt; 0.01), with the regression model (Hct = [0.51 * HUblood] + 17.4) describing the association. Synthetic ECV correlated well with conventional ECV (R2 = 0.96; p &lt; 0.01) with minimal bias and 2SD difference of 5.7%. Synthetic ECV correlated as well as conventional ECV with histological CVF (both R2 = 0.50, p &lt; 0.01). Finally, we implemented an automatic ECV plug-in for offline analysis. Conclusion Synthetic ECV by CCT provides instantaneous quantification of the myocardial extracellular space without the need for blood sampling. © 2017 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography","Cardiac amyloidosis; Computed tomography; Extracellular matrix; Myocardial extracellular volume fraction; Myocardial fibrosis; Myocardial tissue characterization","iohexol; adult; amyloidosis; aortic stenosis; Article; cardiac imaging; clinical article; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; extracellular space; female; heart amyloidosis; hematocrit; human; human tissue; male; middle aged; priority journal; retrospective study; automation; blood; cardiac muscle; cardiomyopathy; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; fibrosis; multidetector computed tomography; observer variation; pathology; predictive value; procedures; regression analysis; reproducibility; Amyloidosis; Automation; Cardiomyopathies; Fibrosis; Hematocrit; Humans; Multidetector Computed Tomography; Myocardium; Observer Variation; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies",,"iohexol, 66108-95-0","omnipaque, Nycomed, NorwaySomatom Sensation 64, Siemens Healthcare, Germany","Nycomed, NorwaySiemens Healthcare, Germany","Bandula, S., White, S.K., Flett, A.S., Measurement of myocardial extracellular volume fraction by using equilibrium contrast-enhanced CT: validation against histologic findings (2013) Radiology, 269, pp. 396-403; Nacif, M.S., Kawel, N., Lee, J.J., Interstitial myocardial fibrosis assessed as extracellular volume fraction with low-radiation-dose cardiac CT (2012) Radiology, 264, pp. 876-883; Nacif, M.S., Liu, Y., Yao, J., 3D left ventricular extracellular volume fraction by low-radiation dose cardiac CT: assessment of interstitial myocardial fibrosis (2013) J Cardiovasc Comput Tomogr, 7, pp. 51-57; Treibel, T.A., Bandula, S., Fontana, M., Extracellular volume quantification by dynamic equilibrium cardiac computed tomography in cardiac amyloidosis (2015) J Cardiovasc Comput Tomogr, 9 (6), pp. 585-592. , Nov-Dec; Kurita, Y., Kitagawa, K., Kurobe, Y., Estimation of myocardial extracellular volume fraction with cardiac CT in subjects without clinical coronary artery disease: a feasibility study (2016) J Cardiovasc Comput Tomogr, 10, pp. 237-241; Ugander, M., Oki, A.J., Hsu, L.Y., Extracellular volume imaging by magnetic resonance imaging provides insights into overt and sub-clinical myocardial pathology (2012) Eur Heart J, 33, pp. 1268-1278; Banypersad, S.M., Fontana, M., Maestrini, V., T1 mapping and survival in systemic light-chain amyloidosis (2015) Eur Heart J, 36, pp. 244-251; Wong, T.C., Piehler, K., Meier, C.G., Association between extracellular matrix expansion quantified by cardiovascular magnetic resonance and short-term mortality (2012) Circulation, 126, pp. 1206-1216; Wong, T.C., Piehler, K.M., Kang, I.A., Myocardial extracellular volume fraction quantified by cardiovascular magnetic resonance is increased in diabetes and associated with mortality and incident heart failure admission (2014) Eur Heart J, 35, pp. 657-664; Schelbert, E.B., Fonarow, G.C., Bonow, R.O., Butler, J., Gheorghiade, M., Therapeutic targets in heart failure: refocusing on the myocardial interstitium (2014) J Am Coll Cardiol, 63, pp. 2188-2198; Moon, J.C., Treibel, T.A., Schelbert, E.B., T1 mapping for diffuse myocardial fibrosis: a key biomarker in cardiac disease?

We have developed a novel cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol that allows assessment of central hemodynamics, including central aortic systolic blood pressure, resistance, total arterial compliance, pulse wave velocity, and wave reflections. The main study aims were to (1) characterize group differences in central aortic systolic blood pressure and peripheral systolic blood pressure, (2) comprehensively evaluate afterload (including wave reflections) in the 2 groups, and (3) identify possible biomarkers among covariates associated with elevated left ventricular mass (LVM). Fifty adult patients with repaired coarctation and 25 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. Ascending aorta area and flow waveforms were obtained using a high temporal-resolution spiral phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance flow sequence. These data were used to derive central hemodynamics and to perform wave intensity analysis noninvasively. Covariates associated with LVM were assessed using multivariable linear regression analysis. There were no significant group differences (P≥0.1) in brachial systolic, mean, or diastolic BP. However central aortic systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in patients compared with controls (113 versus 107 mm Hg, P=0.002). Patients had reduced total arterial compliance, increased pulse wave velocity, and larger backward compression waves compared with controls. LVM index was significantly higher in patients than controls (72 versus 59 g/m 2, P<0.0005). The magnitude of the backward compression waves was independently associated with variation in LVM (P=0.01). Using a novel, noninvasive hemodynamic assessment, we have shown abnormal conduit vessel function after coarctation of the aorta repair, including abnormal wave reflections that are associated with elevated LVM. © 2017 The Authors.","blood pressure;

This requires additional assessment of cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen content difference. We developed magnetic resonance (MR)-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing to achieve this goal and assessed children with right heart disease.METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy controls (n=10) and children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; n=10) and repaired tetralogy of Fallot (n=10) underwent MR-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing. All exercises were performed on an MR-compatible ergometer, and oxygen uptake was continuously acquired using a modified metabolic cart. Simultaneous cardiac output was measured using a real-time MR flow sequence and combined with oxygen uptake to calculate arteriovenous oxygen content difference. Peak oxygen uptake was significantly lower in the PAH group (12.6±1.31 mL/kg per minute; P=0.01) and trended toward lower in the tetralogy of Fallot group (13.5±1.29 mL/kg per minute; P=0.06) compared with controls (16.7±1.37 mL/kg per minute). Although tetralogy of Fallot patients had the largest increase in cardiac output, they had lower resting (3±1.2 L/min per m2) and peak (5.3±1.2 L/min per m2) values compared with controls (resting 4.3±1.2 L/min per m2 and peak 6.6±1.2 L/min per m2) and PAH patients (resting 4.5±1.1 L/min per m2 and peak 5.9±1.1 L/min per m2). Both the PAH and tetralogy of Fallot patients had blunted exercise-induced increases in arteriovenous oxygen content difference. However, only the PAH patients had significantly reduced peak values (6.9±1.3 mlO2/100 mL) compared with controls (8.4±1.4 mlO2/100 mL; P=0.005).CONCLUSIONS: MR-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing is feasible in both healthy children and children with cardiac disease.

Materials and Methods: The sequence was based on an efficient uniform density spiral acquisition, combined with data acceleration. A novel acquisition and reconstruction strategy enabled combination of UNFOLD (2×) and SENSE (3×): UNFOLD-ed SENSE. The sequence was retrospectively cardiac-gated, and a graphics processing unit (GPU) was used for rapid “online” reconstruction. The optimal UNFOLD parameters for the data were calculated using an in silico model. The technique was validated on a 1.5T MR scanner in 15 patients with known aortic valve disease, against a respiratory self-navigated free-breathing TPM technique. Quantitative image quality measures (velocity-to-noise and edge sharpness) were made as well as calculation of longitudinal, radial, and tangential myocardial velocities in the left ventricle. Results: The proposed breath-hold TPM data took eight heartbeats to acquire. The breath-hold TPM images had significantly higher edge sharpness (P = 0.0014) than the self-navigated TPM images, but with significantly lower velocity-to-noise ratio (P < 0.0001). There was excellent agreement (r > 0.94) in the longitudinal, radial, and tangential velocities between the self-navigated data and the proposed breath-hold TPM sequence. Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of using spiral UNFOLD-ed SENSE to measure myocardial velocities using a rapid breath-hold spiral TPM sequence. This novel technique might enable accurate measurement of myocardial velocities, in a short scan time, which is especially important in a busy clinical workflow. J. MAGN. RESON.

This response is usually beneficial, improving the chance of overcoming environmental challenges, but costs resources such as energy. Humans and other animals are known to adapt their responses to acute stress when they are stimulated chronically, presumably to optimise resource utilisation. Characterisation of these adaptations has been limited. Using advanced imaging techniques, we show that cardiovascular and endocrine physiology, reflective of energy utilisation during acute stress, and energy storage (fat) differ between the sexes when they are exposed to chronic stress. We examine possible evolutionary explanations for these differences, related to energy use, and point out how these physiological differences could underpin known disparities between the sexes in their risk of important cardiometabolic disorders such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. Abstract: Obesity and associated diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, are the dominant human health problems in the modern era. Humans develop these conditions partly because they consume excess energy and exercise too little. Stress might be one of the factors contributing to these disease-promoting behaviours. We postulate that sex-specific primordial energy optimisation strategies exist, which developed to help cope with chronic stress but have become maladaptive in modern societies, worsening health. To demonstrate the existence of these energy optimisation strategies, we recruited 88 healthy adults with varying adiposity and chronic stress exposure. Cardiovascular physiology at rest and during acute stress (Montreal Imaging Stress Task), and body fat distribution were measured using advanced magnetic resonance imaging methods, together with endocrine function, cardiovascular energy use and cognitive performance. Potential confounders such as lifestyle, social class and employment were accounted for. We found that women exposed to chronic stress had lower adiposity, greater acute stress cardiovascular responses and better cognitive performance. Conversely, chronic stress-exposed men had greater adiposity and lower cardiovascular responses to acute stress. These results provide initial support for our hypothesis that differing sex-specific energy conservation strategies exist. We propose that these strategies have initially evolved to benefit humans but are now maladaptive and increase the risk of disorders such as obesity, especially in men exposed to chronic stress. © 2016 The Authors.

This study devised a simple isometric exercise CMR methodology and assessed the hemodynamic response evoked by isometric exercise. Methods: A biceps isometric exercise technique was devised for CMR, and 75 healthy volunteers were assessed at rest, after 3-minute biceps exercise, and 5-minute of recovery using: 1) blood pressure (BP) and 2) CMR measured aortic flow and left ventricular function. Total peripheral resistance (SVR) and arterial compliance (TAC), cardiac output (CO), left ventricular volumes and function (ejection fraction, stroke volume, power output), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and rate pressure product were assessed at all time points. Results: Image quality was preserved during stress. During exercise there were increases in CO (+14.9 %), HR (+17.0 %), SVR (+9.8 %), systolic BP (+22.4 %), diastolic BP (+25.4 %) and mean BP (+23.2 %). In addition, there were decreases in TAC (-22.0 %) and left ventricular ejection fraction (-6.3 %). Age and body mass index modified the evoked response, even when resting measures were similar. Conclusions: Isometric exercise technique evokes a significant cardiovascular response in CMR, unmasking physiological differences that are not apparent at rest. Key points: • Isometric exercise unmasks cardiovascular differences not evident at rest. • CMR is the reference standard for non-invasive cardiovascular assessment at rest. • A new easily replicable method combines isometric exercise with CMR. • Significant haemodynamic changes occur and differences are unmasked. • The physiological, isometric CMR stressor can be easily replicated. © 2015, European Society of Radiology.","Cardiac imaging technique;

It is not clear whether this increased flow demand is compensated by a rise in cardiac output (CO) alone or by redistribution of blood flow from other organs. We used a new comprehensive imaging method to assess the human cardiovascular response to food ingestion. Following a 12-h fast, blood flow in segments of the aorta and in organspecific arteries, and ventricular volumes were assessed in 20 healthy adults using MRI at rest and following ingestion of a high-energy liquid meal. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) fell substantially and CO rose significantly. Blood pressure remained stable. These changes were predominantly driven by a rapid fall in mesenteric vascular resistance, resulting in over four times more intestinal blood flow. Renal vascular resistance also declined but less dramatically. No changes in blood flow to the celiac territory, the brain, or the limbs were observed. In conclusion, this is the first study to fully characterize systemic and regional changes in vascular resistance after food ingestion in humans. Our findings show that the postprandial drop in SVR is fully compensated for by increased CO and not by redistribution of blood from other organs. With the exception of a modest increase in renal blood flow, there was no evidence of altered blood flow to nondigestive organs. The proposed oral food challenge protocol can be applied safely in an MRI environment and may be useful for studying the involvement of the gut in systemic or cardiovascular disease. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.","Humans;

Therefore, right ventricular (RV) disease in pulmonary hypertension (PH) can result in abnormal left ventricular (LV) myocardial mechanics. To assess this, we implemented novel cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) tissue phase mapping (TPM) to assess radial, longitudinal and tangential LV myocardial velocities in patients with PH. Methods: Respiratory self-gated TPM was performed using a rotating golden-angle spiral acquisition with retrospective cardiac gating. TPM of a mid ventricular slice was acquired in 40 PH patients and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Endocardial and epicardial LV borders were manually defined, and myocardial velocities calculated using in-house software. Patients without proximal CTEPH (chronic thromboembolic PH) and not receiving intravenous prostacyclin therapy (n = 34) were followed up until the primary outcome of disease progression (death, transplantation, or progression to intravenous therapy) or the end of the study. Physicians who determined disease progression were blinded to CMR data. Conventional ventricular volumetric indices and novel TPM metrics were analyzed for prediction of 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and disease progression. Results: Peak longitudinal (p < 0.0001) and radial (p = 0.001) early diastolic (E) wave velocities were significantly lower in PH patients compared with healthy volunteers. Reversal of tangential E waves was observed in all patients and was highly discriminative for the presence of PH (p < 0.0001). The global radial E wave (β = 0.41, p = 0.017) and lateral wall radial systolic (S) wave velocities (β = 0.33, p = 0.028) were the only independent predictors of 6MWD in a model including RV ejection fraction (RVEF) and LV stroke volume. Over a median follow-up period of 20 months (IQR 7.9 months), 8 patients commenced intravenous therapy and 1 died. Global longitudinal E wave was the only independent predictor of clinical worsening (6.3× increased risk, p = 0.009) in a model including RVEF and septal curvature. Conclusions: TPM metrics of LV diastolic function are significantly abnormal in PH. More importantly, abnormal LV E wave velocities are the only independent predictors of functional capacity and clinical worsening in a model that includes conventional metrics of biventricular function. © 2015 Knight et al.","Cardiovascular magnetic resonance;

In order to exploit these capabilities (e.g., for decision-making), it is necessary to validate computational models against real world data. In this study, we sought to acquire 4D CMR flow data in a controllable, experimental setup and use these data to validate a corresponding computational model. We applied this paradigm to a case of congenital heart disease, namely, transposition of the great arteries (TGA) repaired with arterial switch operation. For this purpose, a mock circulatory loop compatible with the CMR environment was constructed and two detailed aortic 3D models (i.e., one TGA case and one normal aortic anatomy) were tested under realistic hemodynamic conditions, acquiring 4D CMR flow. The same 3D domains were used for multi-scale CFD simulations, whereby the remainder of the mock circulatory system was appropriately summarized with a lumped parameter network. Boundary conditions of the simulations mirrored those measured in vitro. Results showed a very good quantitative agreement between experimental and computational models in terms of pressure (overall maximum % error = 4.4% aortic pressure in the control anatomy) and flow distribution data (overall maximum % error = 3.6% at the subclavian artery outlet of the TGA model). Very good qualitative agreement could also be appreciated in terms of streamlines, throughout the cardiac cycle. Additionally, velocity vectors in the ascending aorta revealed less symmetrical flow in the TGA model, which also exhibited higher wall shear stress in the anterior ascending aorta. © Copyright © 2015 Biglino, Cosentino, Steeden, De Nova, Castelli, Ntsinjana, Pennati, Taylor and Schievano.","cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging;

In this study we used pulmonary vessel area and flow obtained using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to implement WIA noninvasively. We hypothesized that this method could detect differences in reflections in PH patients compared with healthy controls and could also differentiate certain PH subtypes. Twenty patients with PH (35% CTEPH and 75% female) and 10 healthy controls (60% female) were recruited. Right and left pulmonary artery (LPA and RPA) flow and area curves were acquired using self-gated golden-angle, spiral, phase-contrast CMR with a 10.5-ms temporal resolution. These data were used to perform WIA on patients and controls. The presence of a proximal clot in CTEPH patients was determined from contemporaneous computed tomography/angiographic data. A backwards-traveling compression wave (BCW) was present in both LPA and RPA of all PH patients but was absent in all controls (P = 6e-8). The area under the BCW was associated with a sensitivity of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 63-100%] and specificity of 91% (95% CI 75-98%) for the presence of a clot in the proximal PAs of patients with CTEPH. In conclusion, WIA metrics were significantly different between patients and controls; in particular, the presence of an early BCW was specifically associated with PH. The magnitude of the area under the BCW showed discriminatory capacity for the presence of proximal PA clot in patients with CTEPH. We believe that these results demonstrate that WIA could be used in the noninvasive assessment of PH. © American Physiological Society.","Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Hemodynamics; Pulmonary hypertension;

This study proposes a free-breathing (FB) time resolved MRA (TRA) technique for use in pediatric and adult congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods: A TRA sequence was developed by combining spiral trajectories with sensitivity encoding (SENSE, x4 kx-ky and x2 kz) and partial Fourier (75% in kz). As no temporal data sharing is used, an independent 3D data set was acquired every ∼1.3s, with acceptable spatial resolution (∼2.3x2.3x2.3mm). The technique was tested during FB over 50 consecutive volumes. Conventional BH-MRA and FB-TRA data was acquired in 45 adults and children with CHD. We calculated quantitative image quality for both sequences. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed in all patients from both sequences. Additionally, vessel measurements were made at the sinotubular junction (N = 43), proximal descending aorta (N = 43), descending aorta at the level of the diaphragm (N = 43), main pulmonary artery (N = 35), left pulmonary artery (N = 35) and the right pulmonary artery (N = 35). Intra and inter observer variability was assessed in a subset of 10 patients. Results: BH-MRA had significantly higher homogeneity in non-contrast enhancing tissue (coefficient of variance, P <0.0001), signal-to-noise ratio (P <0.0001), contrast-to-noise ratio (P <0.0001) and relative contrast (P = 0.02) compared to the FB-TRA images. However, homogeneity in the vessels was similar in both techniques (P = 0.52) and edge sharpness was significantly (P <0.0001) higher in FB-TRA compared to BH-MRA. BH-MRA provided overall diagnostic accuracy of 82%, and FB-TRA of 87%, with no statistical difference between the two sequences (P = 0.77). Vessel diameter measurements showed excellent agreement between the two techniques (r = 0.98, P <0.05), with no bias (0.0mm, P = 0.71), and clinically acceptable limits of agreement (-2.7 to +2.8mm). Inter and intra observer reproducibility showed good agreement of vessel diameters (r>0.988, P<0.0001), with negligible biases (between -0.2 and +0.1mm) and small limits of agreement (between -2.4 and +2.5mm). Conclusions: We have described a FB-TRA technique that is shown to enable accurate diagnosis and vessel measures compared to conventional BH-MRA. This simplifies the MRA technique and will enable angiography to be performed in children and adults whom find breath-holding difficult. © 2015 Steeden et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","3D stack-of-spirals;

Seventeen healthy adults underwent CPET and MR-CPET using an MR compatible ergometer and CPET system customised for MR use. Continuous aortic flow measurement used a validated UNFOLD-SENSE spiral phase contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) sequence. Fifteen of 17 volunteers completed exercise; exclusions were due to claustrophobia and inability to effectively master exercise technique. Measures of acceptability were lower but still satisfactory for MR-CPET. There were strong correlations between conventional and MR-CPET for peak VO2 (r = 0.94, p &lt; 0.001); VCO2 (r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001) and VE (r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated peak CO and ΔcO2 were independent predictors of peak VO2 measured during MR-CPET (β = 0.73 and 0.38 p &lt; 0.0001) and conventional CPET (β = 0.78, 0.28 p &lt; 0.0001). MR-CPET is feasible, acceptable and demonstrates physiology not apparent with conventional CPET. MR-CPET allows differentiation of the contributions of CO and ΔcO2 to variation in peak VO2. We believe that this will be useful in understanding the origin of reduced exercise capacity in cardiac disease. © 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","cardio pulmonary exercise test; CMR; exercise","Linear regression; Magnetic resonance; Oxygen; Aortic flow; Cardiac output; Cardio pulmonary exercise test; Cardiovascular function; CMR; Exercise; Exercise test; MR-compatible; Oxygen consumption; Peak values; Vanadium dioxide; adult; exercise test; feasibility study; female; heart output; human; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen consumption; procedures; Adult; Cardiac Output; Exercise Test; Feasibility Studies; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Oxygen Consumption",,,,,"Astrand, P.O., Measurement of maximal aerobic capacity (1967) Can.

Materials and Methods In 20 healthy volunteers RAGS ( ~6 sec breath-hold) and respiratory-navigated cine ( ~5 min) PCMR were performed in both renal arteries to assess RBF. A simulation of RAGS PCMR was used to assess the effect of heart rate (30-105 bpm), vessel expandability (0-150%) and translational motion (x1.0-4.0) on the accuracy of RBF measurements. Results There was good agreement between RAGS and cine PCMR in the volunteer study (bias: 0.01 L/min, limits of agreement: -0.04 to +0.06 L/min, P = 0.0001). The simulation demonstrated a positive linear relationship between heart rate and error (r = 0.9894, P < 0.0001), a negative linear relationship between vessel expansion and error (r = -0.9484, P < 0.0001), and a nonlinear, heart rate-dependent relationship between vessel translation and error. Conclusion We have demonstrated that RAGS PCMR accurately measures RBF in vivo. However, the simulation reveals limitations in this technique at extreme heart rates (<40 bpm, >100 bpm), or when there is significant motion (vessel expandability: >80%, vessel translation: >x2.2). © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","breath-hold; fast; flow; renal; spiral","adult; artery blood flow; Article; averaging; breath holding; computer simulation; contrast enhancement; female; flow measurement; heart movement; heart rate; human; human experiment; image analysis; image quality; kidney blood flow; male; measurement error; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; renal artery; RR interval; RR interval averaged golden angle spiral phase contrast magnetic resonance; signal noise ratio; algorithm; blood flow velocity; breath holding; cardiac gated imaging; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation study; kidney artery; kidney circulation; magnetic resonance angiography; middle aged; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; Adult; Algorithms; Blood Flow Velocity; Breath Holding; Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Artery; Renal Circulation; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",,,"Avanto, Siemens, Germany","Siemens, Germany","Firmin, D.N., Nayler, G.L., Klipstein, R.H., Underwood, S.R., Rees, R.S.O., Longmore, D.B., In vivo validation of MR velocity imaging (1987) J Comput Assist Tomogr, 11, pp. 751-756; Beerbaum, P., Korperich, H., Barth, P., Esdorn, H., Gieseke, J., Meyer, H., Noninvasive quantification of left-to-right shunt in pediatric patients: Phase-contrast cine magnetic resonance imaging compared with invasive oximetry (2001) Circulation, 103, pp. 2476-2482; Van Rossum, A.C., Visser, F.C., Peels, K.H., Valk, J., Roos, J.P., An in vivo validation of quantitative blood flow imaging in arteries and veins using magnetic resonance phase-shift techniques (1991) Eur Heart J, 12, p. 117; Park, J.B., Olcott, E.W., Nishimura, D.G., Rapid measurement of time-averaged blood flow using ungated spiral phase-contrast (2003) Magn Reson Med, 49, pp. 322-328; Park, J., Santos, J.M., Hargreaves, B., Rapid measurement of renal artery blood flow with ungated spiral phase-contrast MRI (2005) J Magn Reson Imaging, 21, pp. 590-595; Park, J.B., Hu, B.S., Conolly, S.M., Nayak, K.S., Nishimura, D.G., Rapid cardiac-output measurement with ungated spiral phase contrast (2006) Magn Reson Med, 56, pp. 432-438; Winkelmann, S., Schaeffter, T., Koehler, T., Eggers, H., Doessel, O., An optimal radial profile order based on the golden ratio for time-resolved MRI (2007) IEEE Trans Med Imaging, 26, pp. 68-76; Kim, Y.-C., Narayanan, S.S., Nayak, K.S., Flexible retrospective selection of temporal resolution in real-time speech MRI using a golden-ratio spiral view order (2011) Magn Reson Med, 65, pp. 1365-1371; Hansen, M.S., Sørensen, T.S., Arai, A.E., Kellman, P., Retrospective reconstruction of high temporal resolution cine images from real-time MRI using iterative motion correction (2012) Magn Reson Med, 68, pp. 741-750; Pruessmann, K.P., Weiger, M.K., Bornert, P., Boesiger, P., Advances in sensitivity encoding with arbitrary k-space trajectories (2001) Magn Reson Med, 46, pp. 638-651; Nezafat, R., Kellman, P., Derbyshire, J.A., McVeigh, E.R., Real time high spatial-temporal resolution flow imaging with spiral MRI using auto-calibrated SENSE.

Methods: The sequence utilized spiral trajectories with an acquisition strategy that allowed a combination of temporal encoding (Unaliasing by fourier-encoding the overlaps using the temporal dimension; UNFOLD) and parallel imaging (Sensitivity encoding; SENSE) to be used (UNFOLDed-SENSE). An in silico experiment was performed to determine the optimum UNFOLD filter. In vitro experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of time intervals calculation and peak mean velocity quantification. In addition, 15 healthy volunteers were imaged with the new sequence, and cardiac time intervals were compared to reference standard Doppler echocardiography measures. For comparison, in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments were also carried out using sliding window reconstructions. Results: The in vitro experiments demonstrated good agreement between real-time spiral UNFOLDed-SENSE phase contrast MR and the reference standard measurements of velocity and time intervals. The protocol was successfully performed in all volunteers. Subsequent measurement of time intervals produced values in keeping with literature values and good agreement with the gold standard echocardiography. Importantly, the proposed UNFOLDed-SENSE sequence outperformed the sliding window reconstructions. Conclusion: Cardiac time intervals can be successfully assessed with UNFOLDed-SENSE real-time spiral phase contrast. Real-time MR assessment of cardiac time intervals may be beneficial in assessment of patients with cardiac conditions such as diastolic dysfunction. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Cardiac timing intervals;

The arctangent model also required calibration with pulse wave velocity. Carotid tonometry CASP was used as the reference standard.Purpose: Central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) is a more accurate measure of load and cardiovascular risk than brachial pressure. Unfortunately, CASP is difficult to measure using current methods. In this study we report three methods of determining CASP by combining MRderived aortic area curves with different models of the pressure-area relationship.Results: Brachial systolic pressure correlated only moderately with carotid CASP r2=0.46 (P=0.01). However, arctangent, exponential, and linear CASP correlated strongly with carotid CASP, r2=0.90, r2=0.86, r2=0.85, respectively (P&lt;0.0001). There was excellent agreement between carotid CASP and both arctangent (bias 1.5; SD 3.3) and exponential CASP (bias 0.6; SD 3.6). There was a slight underestimation using the linear model (bias -2.3; SD 3.8) and poor agreement and overestimation using brachial systolic pressure (bias 12.9; SD 8.0).Conclusion: We have shown that CASP can be derived from MR data: arctangent and exponential methods being superior to the linear method. The superior correlation of MR derived CASP over brachial systolic BP suggests these measures will allow more comprehensive assessment of systemic arterial hypertension. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Central aortic blood pressure;

We hypothesized that septal curvature could be used to estimate right ventricular afterload and track acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics. Methods and Results-Fifty patients with a median age of 6.7 years (range, 0.45-16.5 years) underwent combined cardiac catheterization and cardiovascular magnetic resonance. The majority had idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (n=30); the remaining patients had pulmonary hypertension associated with repaired congenital heart disease (n=17) or lung disease (n=3). Mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were acquired at baseline and during vasodilation. Septal curvature was measured using real-time cardiovascular magnetic resonance. There was a strong correlation between mean pulmonary artery pressure and SCmin at baseline and during vasodilator testing (r=-0.81 and -0.85, respectively; P&lt;0.01). A strong linear relationship also existed between pulmonary vascular resistance and minimum septal curvature indexed to cardiac output both at baseline and during vasodilator testing (r=-0.88 and -0.87, respectively; P&lt;0.01). Change in septal curvature metrics moderately correlated with absolute change in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, respectively (r=0.58 and -0.74; P&lt;0.01). Septal curvature metrics were able to identify vasoresponders with a sensitivity of 83% (95% confdence interval, 0.36-0.99) and a specifcity of 91% (95% confdence interval, 0.77-0.97), using the Sitbon criteria. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension subgroup analysis revealed 3 responders with ΔSCmin values of 0.523, 0.551, and 0.568. If the middle value of 0.551 is taken as a cutoff, the approximate sensitivity would be 67% and the specifcity would be 93%. Conclusions-Septal curvature metrics are able to estimate right ventricular afterload and track acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics during vasodilator testing. This suggests that septal curvature could be used for continuing assessment of load in pulmonary hypertension. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.","Hypertension, pulmonary; Pediatrics; Vasodilator agents","hypertension, pulmonary; pediatrics; vasodilator agents; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Cardiac Catheterization; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulmonary Wedge Pressure; Reproducibility of Results; Vascular Resistance; Vasodilation; Ventricular Function, Right; Ventricular Septum",,,,,"Van Wolferen, S.A., Marcus, J.T., Boonstra, A., Marques, K.M., Bronzwaer, J.G., Spreeuwenberg, M.D., Postmus, P.E., Vonk-Noordegraaf, A., Prognostic value of right ventricular mass, volume, and function in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (2007) Eur Heart J., 28, pp. 1250-1257; Vonk Noordegraaf, A., Galiè, N., The role of the right ventricle in pulmonary arterial hypertension (2011) Eur Respir Rev., 20, pp. 243-253; Vonk-Noordegraaf, A., Souza, R., Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: What can it add to our knowledge of the right ventricle in pulmonary arterial hypertension?

Methods The sequence was based on a golden-angle spiral acquisition. Reconstruction of real-time images allowed creation of an image-based navigator. The expiratory spiral interleaves were then retrospectively cardiac-gated using data binning. TPM data were acquired in 20 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with pulmonary hypertension. Longitudinal and radial myocardial velocities were calculated in the left ventricle and right ventricle. Results The image-based navigator was shown to correlate well with simultaneously acquired airflow data in 10 volunteers(r=0.93±0.04). The TPM navigated images had a significantly higher subjective image quality and edge sharpness (P<0.0001) than averaged spiral TPM. No significant differences in myocardial velocities were seen between conventional Cartesian TPM with navigator respiratory-gating and the proposed self-navigated TPM technique, in 10 volunteers. Significant differences in the velocities were seen between the volunteers and patients in the left ventricle at systole and end diastole and in the right ventricle at end diastole. Conclusion The feasibility of measuring myocardial motion using a golden-angle spiral TPM sequence was demonstrated, with an image-based respiratory navigator calculated from the TPM data itself. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","golden-angle;

Effects on lipid status or clotting do not fully explain these benefits. Exaggerated cardiovascular responses to mental stress are detrimental to cardiovascular health. We hypothesized that habitual alcohol consumption might reduce these responses, with potential benefits. Advanced magnetic resonance techniques were used to accurately measure cardiovascular responses to an acute mental stressor (Montreal Imaging Stress Task) in 88 healthy adults (∼1:1 male:female). Salivary cortisol and task performance measures were used to assess endocrine and cognitive responses. Habitual alcohol consumption and confounding factors were assessed by questionnaire. Alcohol consumption was inversely related to responses of heart rate (HR) (r=-0.31, p=0.01), cardiac output (CO) (r=-0.32, p=0.01), vascular resistance (r=0.25, p=0.04) and mean blood pressure (r=-0.31, p=0.01) provoked by stress, but not to stroke volume (SV), or arterial compliance changes. However, high alcohol consumers had greater cortisol stress responses, compared to moderate consumers (3.5 versus 0.7nmol/L, p=0.04). Cognitive measures did not differ. Findings were not explained by variations in age, sex, social class, ethnicity, physical activity, adrenocortical activity, adiposity, smoking, menstrual phase and chronic stress. Habitual alcohol consumption is associated with reduced cardiac responsiveness during mental stress, which has been linked to lower risk of hypertension and vascular disease. Consistent with established evidence, our findings suggest a mechanism by which moderate alcohol consumption might reduce cardiovascular disease, but not high consumption, where effects such as greater cortisol stress responses may negate any benefits. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.","Alcohol;

Materials and Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers underwent aortic flow examination during exercise using a real-time spiral PCMR sequence. Acquired data were reconstructed in online fashion using an iterative sensitivity encoding (SENSE) algorithm implemented on an external computer equipped with a GPU card. Importantly, data were sent back to the scanner console for viewing. A multithreaded CPU implementation of the real-time PCMR reconstruction was used as a reference point for the online GPU reconstruction assessment and validation. A semiautomated segmentation and registration algorithm was applied for flow data analysis. Results: There was good agreement between the GPU and CPU reconstruction (-0.4 ± 0.8 mL). There was a significant speed-up compared to the CPU reconstruction (15×). This translated into the flow data being available on the scanner console ≈9 seconds after acquisition finished. This compares to an estimated time using the CPU implementation of 83 minutes. Conclusion: Our heterogeneous image reconstruction system provides a base for translation of complex MRI algorithms into clinical workflow. We demonstrated its feasibility using real-time PCMR assessment of continuous cardiac output as an example. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","continuous flow assessment; GPU; heterogeneous systems; real-time PCMR","adult; aorta flow; article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; computer graphics; computer system; female; heart output; heart output measurement; human; human experiment; image analysis; image processing; image quality; image reconstruction; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; Adult; Algorithms; Aorta; Blood Flow Velocity; Cardiac Output; Computer Graphics; Computer Systems; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",,,"Avanto, Siemens, Germany; GeForce 480, nvidia, United States","nvidia, United States; Siemens, Germany","White, S.W., Quail, A.W., De Leeuw, P.W., Impedance cardiography for cardiac output measurement: An evaluation of accuracy and limitations (1990) Eur Heart J, 11 (SUPPL.

Methods: We studied 21 children with single ventricle physiology after bidirectional superior cavopulmonary surgery: 10 with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, who underwent surgical arch reconstruction, and 11 with other types of single ventricle physiology but without arch reconstruction. All children underwent pre-Fontan magnetic resonance imaging. No patient exhibited aortic recoarctation. Data on aortic wave speed, aortic distensibility and wave intensity profiles were all extracted from the magnetic resonance imaging studies using an in-house-written plug-in for the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine viewer OsiriX. Results: Children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome had significantly greater wave speed (P = .002), and both stiffer (P = .004) and larger (P < .0001) ascending aortas than the patients with a nonreconstructed arch. Aortic distensibility was not influenced by ventricular stroke volume but depended on a combination of increased aortic diameter and abnormal wall mechanical properties. Those with hypoplastic left heart syndrome had a lower peak wave intensity and reduced energy carried by the forward compression and the forward expansion waves, even after correction for stroke volume, suggesting an abnormal systolic and diastolic function. Lower wave energy was associated with an increased aortic diameter. Conclusions: Using a novel, noninvasive technique based on image analysis, we have demonstrated that aortic arch reconstruction in children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome is associated with reduced aortic distensibility and unfavorable ventricular-vascular coupling compared with those with single ventricle physiology without aortic arch reconstruction.

Flow-velocity and area can both be derived from high-resolution phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (PC-CMR). In this study, very high temporal resolution PC-CMR data is processed using an integrated and semi-automatic technique to derive wave intensity. Methods: Wave intensity was derived in terms of area and velocity changes. These data were directly derived from PC-CMR using a breath-hold spiral sequence accelerated with sensitivity encoding (SENSE). Image processing was integrated in a plug-in for the DICOM viewer OsiriX, including calculations of wave speed and wave intensity. Ascending and descending aortic data from 15 healthy volunteers (30 ± 6 years) data were used to test the method for feasibility, and intra- and inter-observer variability. Ascending aortic data were also compared with results from 15 patients with coronary heart disease (61 ± 13 years) to assess the clinical usefulness of the method. Results: Rapid image acquisition (11 s breath-hold) and image processing was feasible in all volunteers. Wave speed was physiological (5.8 ± 1.3 m/s ascending aorta, 5.0 ± 0.7 m/s descending aorta) and the wave intensity pattern was consistent with traditionally formulated wave intensity. Wave speed, peak forward compression wave in early systole and peak forward expansion wave in late systole at both locations exhibited overall good intra- and inter-observer variability. Patients with coronary heart disease had higher wave speed (p <0.0001), and lower forward compression wave (p <0.0001) and forward expansion wave (p <0.0005) peaks. This difference is likely related to the older age of the patients' cohort, indicating stiffer aortas, as well as compromised ventricular function due to their underlying condition. Conclusion: A non-invasive, semi-automated and reproducible method for performing wave intensity analysis is presented. Its application is facilitated by the use of a very high temporal resolution spiral sequence. A formulation of wave intensity based on area change has also been proposed, involving no assumptions about the cross-sectional shape of the vessel. © 2012 Biglino et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Cardiovascular magnetic resonance;

Resilience to stress may differ according to adiposity. Early studies that addressed this are difficult to interpret due to conflicting findings and limited methods. Recent advances in assessment of cardiovascular stress responses and of fat distribution allow accurate assessment of associations between adiposity and stress responsiveness. We measured responses to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task in healthy men (N = 43) and women (N = 45) with a wide range of BMIs. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) measures were used with novel magnetic resonance measures of stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR) and arterial compliance to assess cardiovascular responses. Salivary cortisol and the number and speed of answers to mathematics problems in the task were used to assess neuroendocrine and cognitive responses, respectively. Visceral and subcutaneous fat was measured using T2*-IDEAL. Greater BMI was associated with generalised blunting of cardiovascular (HR:β = -0.50 bpm.unit-1, P = 0.009; SV:β = -0.33 mL.unit-1, P = 0.01; CO:β = -61 mL.min-1.unit-1, P = 0.002; systolic BP:β = -0.41 mmHg.unit-1, P = 0.01; TPR:β = 0.11 WU.unit-1, P = 0.02), cognitive (correct answers: r = -0.28, P = 0.01; time to answer: r = 0.26, P = 0.02) and endocrine responses (cortisol: r = -0.25, P = 0.04) to stress. These associations were largely determined by visceral adiposity except for those related to cognitive performance, which were determined by both visceral and subcutaneous adiposity. Our findings suggest that adiposity is associated with centrally reduced stress responsiveness. Although this may mitigate some long-term health risks of stress responsiveness, reduced performance under stress may be a more immediate negative consequence. © 2012 Jones et al.",,"hydrocortisone; adult; artery compliance; article; blood pressure measurement; body mass; cardiovascular response; cognition; controlled study; disease association; female; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hormone release; human; human tissue; intraabdominal fat; major clinical study; male; mathematical analysis; mental stress; neuroendocrine system; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; subcutaneous fat; vascular resistance; Adiposity; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Pressure; Cardiac Output; Cardiovascular System; Cognition; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult",,"hydrocortisone, 50-23-7",,,"Calle, E.E., Thun, M.J., Petrelli, J.M., Rodriguez, C., Heath Jr., C.W., Body-mass index and mortality in a prospective cohort of U.S. adults (1999) N Engl J Med, 341, pp. 1097-1105; Wardle, J., Chida, Y., Gibson, E.L., Whitaker, K.L., Steptoe, A., Stress and adiposity: a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies (2011) Obesity, 19, pp. 771-778; Yusuf, S., Hawken, S., Ounpuu, S., Dans, T., Avezum, A., Effect of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with myocardial infarction in 52 countries (the INTERHEART study): case-control study (2004) Lancet, 364, pp. 937-952; Chida, Y., Steptoe, A., Greater cardiovascular responses to laboratory mental stress are associated with poor subsequent cardiovascular risk status: a meta-analysis of prospective evidence (2010) Hypertension, 55, pp. 1026-1032; Pasquali, R., Anconetani, B., Chattat, R., Biscotti, M., Spinucci, G., Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and its relationship to the autonomic nervous system in women with visceral and subcutaneous obesity: effects of the corticotropin-releasing factor/arginine-vasopressin test and of stress (1996) Metabolism, 45, pp. 351-356; Tabara, Y., Kohara, K., Nakagawa, S., Handa, J., Hayashi, M., Effects of obesity and smoking on mental stress-induced blood pressure and augmentation index responses in normotensive young males: the J-SHIPP study (2008) Hypertens Res, 31, pp. 1219-1224; Waldstein, S.R., Burns, H.O., Toth, M.J., Poehlman, E.T., Cardiovascular reactivity and central adiposity in older African Americans (1999) Health Psychol, 18, pp. 221-228; Carroll, D., Phillips, A.C., Der, G., Body mass index, abdominal adiposity, obesity, and cardiovascular reactions to psychological stress in a large community sample (2008) Psychosom Med, 70, pp. 653-660; Jones, A., Steeden, J.A., Pruessner, J.C., Deanfield, J.E., Taylor, A.M., Detailed assessment of the hemodynamic response to psychosocial stress using real-time MRI (2011) J Magn Reson Imaging, 33, pp. 448-454; Kowalik, G., Steeden, J.A., Atkinson, D., Muthurangu, V., A networked GPU reconstructor within the clinical workflow for rapid fat quantification (2011) Proceedings of the 19th Annual Meeting of ISMRM, , (Abstract 2708); Office for National Statistics.

Phase-contrast magnetic resonance underestimates peak velocities. Hence, clinically Doppler ultrasound is used as the reference standard for assessing stenoses. It is possible to accurately measure peak velocity in MR using Fourier velocity encoding (FVE). In this study, a fast, high-resolution slice-selective FVE sequence was developed with the use of spiral trajectories, parallel imaging, and partial Fourier in the velocity dimension and a novel velocity-unwrap technique. The resulting sequence was acquired within a short breath-hold (more than 15 heartbeats) making this FVE technique clinically achievable. Peak velocities were compared from Doppler ultrasound, phase-contrast magnetic resonance, and FVE. Experiments were carried out in vitro and in vivo in 25 patients with congenital heart disease with stenoses. It was shown that in vitro and in vivo phase-contrast magnetic resonance tended to underestimate peak velocity when compared with Doppler ultrasound, whereas FVE agreed well with Doppler ultrasound.

Materials and Methods: The local research ethics committee approved this study, and written consent was obtained from all patients or guardians. Stroke volumes were quantified in 40 patients (mean age ± standard deviation: 21.4 years ± 13.8, age range: 3.0-61.3 years; 22 male patients aged 3.0-38.0 years [mean age, 17.2 years ± 10.5], 18 female patients aged 4.7-61.3 years [mean age, 26.6 years ± 15.9]) with congenital heart disease in the aorta (n = 40), main pulmonary artery (n = 38), right pulmonary artery (n = 22), and left pulmonary artery (n = 24). Stroke volumes were obtained with (a) breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR imaging with SENSE, (b) conventional breath-hold cartesian phase-contrast MR imaging, and (c) reference free-breathing phase-contrast MR imaging. Stroke volumes were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance, Bland-Altman analysis, and correlation coefficients. Results: Imaging time with the breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR sequence was significantly lower than that with the conventional breath-hold phase-contrast MR sequence (∼5 seconds vs ∼16 seconds, respectively; P < .0001). There was excellent agreement in stroke volumes in all vessels between the reference free-breathing sequence (mean volume, 60.3 mL ± 27.3) and the two breath-hold sequences - spiral SENSE phase-contrast MR imaging (mean volume, 59.5 mL ± 27.1; P < .001) and conventional cartesian phase-contrast MR imaging (mean volume, 59.8 mL ± 27.6; P = .268). The limits of agreement were smaller with the spiral breath-hold sequence than with the conventional breath-hold sequence (-4.4 mL, 2.9 mL vs -10.3 mL, 9.3 mL, respectively); correlation was similar (r = 0.998 vs r = 0.984, respectively). Conclusion: Flow volumes can be accurately and reliably quantified by using a spiral SENSE phase-contrast MR sequence, with high spatiotemporal resolution obtained in a short breath hold. © RSNA, 2011.",,"adolescent;

Materials and Methods 22 healthy volunteers (1:1 M:F, 26-64 years) underwent MRI during rest and the MIST. Real-time spiral phase contrast MR, accelerated with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) was used to assess stroke volume (SV), and radial k-t SENSE was used to assess ventricular volumes. Simultaneous heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) measures allowed calculation of cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and arterial compliance (TAC). Endocrine responses were assessed using salivary cortisol. Results In response to stress, BP increased due to increased CO and reduced TAC but not increased SVR, which fell. HR, not SV, determined CO increases. Greater BP responses occurred in men due to greater CO increases and relatively higher SVR. Older participants had greater BP responses due to greater falls in TAC. Greater cortisol response was correlated with greater falls in TAC but resting cortisol and TAC were not related. Conclusion This new approach allows detailed, accurate assessment of stress physiology. Preliminary findings suggest stress exposes relationships, not seen at rest, of cardiovascular function with age, sex, and endocrine function.

Materials and Methods Real-time phase contrast images were acquired to measure flow and stroke volumes in 10 subjects, during free breathing, at rest, and during exercise. A nonrigid registration algorithm was developed to propagate a manually drawn region of interest in the aorta from one frame to all other frames of the real-time sequence (148 images). Thus the technique provided a semi-automatic segmentation over the whole sequence of images. The accuracy was assessed by comparison with manual segmentations in terms of Dice overlap measures and stroke volumes (SV). Results Semi-automatic segmentations were comparable to manual ones (Dice score of 0.89 ± 0.04). Inter-observer reproducibility was similar for manual and semi-automatic segmentations (Dice score of 0.90 ± 0.04 in both cases, the difference was not significant). SV measurements also showed good agreement between manual and semi-automatic segmentations (correlation coefficient r > 0.94), and the differences were not statistically significant.

In this article, we propose a split-acquisition real-time CINE PCMR technique, where the acquisition of flow-encoded and flow-compensated data is divided into separate blocks. By comparing magnitude images, automatic matching of data in cardio-respiratory space allows subtraction of background phase offsets. Thus, the data is acquired in real-time but with phase correction originating from a different heart beat. This effectively doubles the frame rate, allowing either higher temporal or spatial resolution. Two split-acquisition sequences were tested: one with high-temporal resolution and one with high-spatial resolution. Both sequences showed excellent agreement in stroke volumes in 20 adults when validated against cardiac-gated PCMR and interleaved real-time PCMR (cardiac gated: 95.2 ± 20.0 mL, interleaved real-time: 96.2 ± 20.7 mL, high-temporal resolution: 95.6 ± 20.1 mL, high-spatial resolution: 95.5 ± 20.4 mL). In six children, the high-spatial resolution sequence provided more accurate flow measurements than interleaved real-time PCMR, when compared with cardiac-gated PCMR (cardiac gated: 20.6 ± 7.6 mL, interleaved real-time: 24.3 ± 9.2 mL, high-spatial resolution: 20.8 ± 7.8 mL), due to the increased spatial resolution. The matching technique is shown to be accurate (truth: 94.6 ± 21.8, split-acquisition: 95.0 ± 21.9 mL) and quantitative image quality (signal-to-noise ratio, velocity-to-noise ratio and edge sharpness) is acceptable. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","flow quantification; phase-contrast; real-time imaging","Flow measurement; Heart; Magnetic resonance; Signal to noise ratio; Flow quantification; High spatial resolution; High temporal resolution; Phase contrasts; Phase-contrast magnetic resonances; Quantitative images; Realtime imaging; Temporal and spatial; Image resolution; adolescent; adult; article; blood flow; child; clinical article; congenital heart disease; heart cycle; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic parameters; human; image quality; imaging system; infant; intermethod comparison; measurement; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; phase contrast nuclear magnetic resonance; real time nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; time",,,"Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany","Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany","Beerbaum, P., Korperich, H., Barth, P., Esdorn, H., Gieseke, J., Meyer, H., Noninvasive quantification of left-to-right shunt in pediatric patients: Phase-contrast cine magnetic resonance imaging compared with invasive oximetry (2001) Circulation, 103, pp. 2476-2482; Klein, C., Schalla, S., Schnackenburg, B., Bornstedt, A., Fleck, E., Nagel, E., Magnetic resonance flow measurements in real time: Comparison with a standard gradient-echo technique (2001) J Magn Reson Imaging, 14, pp. 306-310; Korperich, H., Gieseke, J., Barth, P., Hoogeveen, R., Esdorn, H., Peterschroder, A., Meyer, H., Beerbaum, P., Flow volume and shunt quantification in pediatric congenital heart disease by real-time magnetic resonance velocity mapping: A validation study (2004) Circulation, 109, pp. 1987-1993; Gatehouse, P.D., Firmin, D.N., Collins, S., Longmore, D.B., Real time blood flow imaging by spiral scan phase velocity mapping (1994) Magn Reson Med, 31, pp. 504-512; Nayak, K.S., Pauly, J.M., Kerr, A.B., Hu, B.S., Nishimura, D.G., Real-time color flow MRI (2000) Magn Reson Med, 43, pp. 251-258; Nezafat, R., Kellman, P., Derbyshire, J.A., McVeigh, E.R., Real time high spatial-temporal resolution flow imaging with spiral MRI using auto-calibrated SENSE (2004) Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, 2004.

Materials and Methods: Twenty healthy adults underwent MRI at rest and during supine exercise at two different exercise levels. Flow volumes were assessed in the ascending aorta using a spiral SENSE real-time PC sequence. The sequence was validated at rest against a vendor supplied gated PC sequence, and also at rest and during exercise against left ventricular volumes assessed using a radial k-t SENSE real-time sequence. Combining the measured flow volumes with simultaneous oscillometric blood pressure measurements, enabled the noninvasive calculations of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and arterial compliance (C). Results: Measured flow volumes correlated very well between the sequences at rest and during exercise. Cardiac output (CO) and heart rate were found to significantly increase during exercise, while SVR and C were found to decrease significantly. Conclusion: Hemodynamic response to exercise can be accurately quantified using a high temporal resolution spiral SENSE real-time flow imaging. This may allow early detection of hypertension and a greater understanding of the early changes in this condition. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cardiovascular imaging; Exercise; Real-time imaging","adult;

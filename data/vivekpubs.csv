Here we propose a deep learning framework for “FReSCO” (Flow Reconstruction and Segmentation for low latency Cardiac Output monitoring). Methods: Deep artifact suppression and segmentation U-Nets were independently trained. Breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR data (N = 516) were synthetically undersampled using a variable-density spiral sampling pattern and gridded to create aliased data for training of the artifact suppression U-net. A subset of the data (N = 96) was segmented and used to train the segmentation U-net. Real-time spiral phase-contrast MR was prospectively acquired and then reconstructed and segmented using the trained models (FReSCO) at low latency at the scanner in 10 healthy subjects during rest, exercise, and recovery periods. Cardiac output obtained via FReSCO was compared with a reference rest CO and rest and exercise compressed-sensing CO. Results: The FReSCO framework was demonstrated prospectively at the scanner. Beat-to-beat heartrate, stroke volume, and CO could be visualized with a mean latency of 622 ms. No significant differences were noted when compared with reference at rest (bias = −0.21 ± 0.50 L/min, p = 0.246) or compressed sensing at peak exercise (bias = 0.12 ± 0.48 L/min, p = 0.458). Conclusions: The FReSCO framework was successfully demonstrated for real-time monitoring of CO during exercise and could provide a convenient tool for assessment of the hemodynamic response to a range of stressors. © 2022 The Authors.

Objectives: To report the 20-year experience of a large UK National Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Service focusing on epidemiology and clinical outcomes. Methods: Consecutive patients presenting between 2001 and 2021 were included, and survival analysis was performed for incident patients. Measurements and Main Results: Of 1,353 patients assessed, a pulmonary hypertension diagnosis was made in 1,101 (81.4%) patients (51% female, median age, 2.6 [interquartile range, 0.8–8.2] years). The most common form was pulmonary arterial hypertension in 48%, followed by 32.3% with pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease. Multiple contributory causes of pulmonary hypertension were common, with 16.9% displaying features of more than one diagnostic group. The annual incidence of childhood pulmonary hypertension was 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3–3.8) per 1 million children, and the prevalence was 18.1 (95% CI, 15.8–20.4) per 1 million. The incidence was highest for pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease in infancy (15.0 [95% CI, 12.7–17.2] per 1 million per year). Overall, 82.4% patients received pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy, and escalation to triple therapy during follow-up was required in 13.1%. In 970 (88.1%) incident patients, transplant-free survival was 86.7% (95% CI, 84.5–89%) at 1 and 68.6% (95% CI, 64.7–72.6%) at 10 years. Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease had the lowest survival (hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.36–2.94; P, 0.001). Conclusions: Clinical phenotypes of pediatric pulmonary hypertension are heterogeneous and overlapping, with clinical phenotypes that evolve throughout childhood. Despite widespread use of pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy, the prognosis remains poor.

We investigated exercise capacity in patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19 with and without self-reported exercise intolerance using magnetic resonance– augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty subjects were enrolled in this single-center prospective observational case-control study, split into 3 equally sized groups: 2 groups of age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched previously hospitalized patients following COVID-19 without clearly identifiable postviral complications and with either self-reported reduced (COVIDreduced ) or fully recovered (COVIDnormal ) exercise capacity; a group of age-and sex-matched healthy controls. The COVIDreduced group had the lowest peak workload (79W [Interquartile range (IQR), 65–100] versus controls 104W [IQR, 86–148]; P=0.01) and shortest exercise duration (13.3±2.8 minutes versus controls 16.6±3.5 minutes; P=0.008), with no differences in these parameters between COVIDnormal patients and controls. The COVIDreduced group had: (1) the lowest peak indexed oxygen uptake (14.9 mL/ minper kg [IQR, 13.1–16.2]) versus controls (22.3 mL/min per kg [IQR, 16.9– 27.6]; P=0.003) and COVIDnormal patients (19.1 mL/ min per kg [IQR, 15.4– 23.7]; P=0.04); (2) the lowest peak indexed cardiac output (4.7±1.2 L/min per m2) versus controls (6.0±1.2 L/min per m2; P=0.004) and COVIDnormal patients (5.7±1.5 L/min per m2; P=0.02), associated with lower indexed stroke volume (SVi:COVIDreduced 39±10 mL/min per m2 versus COVIDnormal 43±7 mL/min per m2 versus controls 48±10 mL/min per m2; P=0.02). There were no differences in peak tissue oxygen extraction or biventricular ejection fractions between groups. There were no associations between COVID-19 illness severity and peak magnetic resonance– augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing metrics. Peak indexed oxygen uptake, indexed cardiac output, and indexed stroke volume all correlated with duration from discharge to magnetic resonance– augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance– augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing suggests failure to augment stroke volume as a potential mechanism of exercise intolerance in previously hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This is unrelated to disease severity and, reassuringly, improves with time from acute illness. © 2022 The Authors.

Deanfield, J.E., Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, United Kingdom","BACKGROUND: Low-grade inflammation in the young may contribute to the early development of cardiovascular disease. We assessed whether circulating levels of glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) were better able to predict the development of adverse cardiovascular disease risk profiles compared with the more commonly used biomarker high-sensitivity CRP (C-reactive protein). METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 3306 adolescents and young adults from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (mean age, 15.4±0.3; n=1750) and Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study (mean age, 32.1±5.0; n=1556) were included. Baseline associations between inflammatory biomarkers, body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, and sub-clinical measures of vascular dysfunction were assessed cross-sectionally in both cohorts. Prospective risk of developing hypertension and metabolic syndrome during 9-to-10-year follow-up were also assessed as surrogate markers for future cardiovascular risk. GlycA showed greater within-subject correlation over 9-to-10-year follow-up in both cohorts compared with CRP, particularly in the younger adolescent group (r=0.36 versus 0.07). In multivariable analyses, GlycA was found to associate with multiple lifestyle-related cardiovascular disease risk factors, cardiometabolic risk factor burden, and vascular dysfunction (eg, mean difference in flow-mediated dilation=−1.2 [−1.8, −0.7]% per z-score increase). In contrast, CRP levels appeared predominantly driven by body mass index and showed little relationship to any measured cardiovascular risk factors or phenotypes. In both cohorts, only GlycA predicted future risk of both hypertension (risk ratio [RR], ≈1.1 per z-score increase for both cohorts) and metabolic syndrome (RR, ≈1.2–1.3 per z-score increase for both cohorts) in 9-to-10-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade inflammation captured by the novel biomarker GlycA is associated with adverse cardiovascular risk profiles from as early as adolescence and predicts future risk of hypertension and metabolic syndrome in up to 10-year follow-up. GlycA is a stable inflammatory biomarker which may capture distinct sources of inflammation in the young and may provide a more sensitive measure than CRP for detecting early cardiovascular risk. © 2022 The Authors.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool that could expand these information and, if integrated with experimentally-obtained velocity fields, would enable to derive a large variety of the flow descriptors of interest. However, the accuracy of the flow parameters is highly influenced by the quality of the input data such as the anatomical model and boundary conditions typically derived from medical images including 4D Flow CMR. We previously proposed a novel approach in which 4D Flow CMR and CFD velocity fields are integrated to obtain an Enhanced 4D Flow CMR (EMRI), allowing to overcome the spatial-resolution limitation of 4D Flow CMR, and enable an accurate quantification of flow. In this paper, the proposed approach is validated in a U bend channel, an idealised model of the human aortic arch. The flow patterns were studied with 4D Flow CMR, CFD and EMRI, and compared with high resolution 2D PIV experiments obtained in pulsatile conditions. The main strengths and limitations of 4D Flow CMR and CFD were illustrated by exploiting the accuracy of PIV by comparing against PIV velocity fields. EMRI flow patterns showed a better qualitative and quantitative agreement with PIV results than the other techniques. EMRI enables to overcome the experimental limitations of MRI-based velocity measurements and the modelling simplifications of CFD, allowing an accurate prediction of complex flow patterns observed experimentally, while satisfying mass and momentum balance equations. © 2021, Biomedical Engineering Society.","4D Flow CMR; Cardiovascular flow; CFD; PIV; U-bend","Flow patterns; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Accurate quantifications; Anatomical modeling; Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging; Experimental validations; Momentum balance equations; Particle image velocimetries; Quantitative agreement; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Computational fluid dynamics; aortic arch; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; computational fluid dynamics; controlled study; diastole; four-dimensional imaging; heart cycle; heart stroke volume; human; image analysis; image processing; image segmentation; measurement accuracy; particle image velocimetry; refraction index; signal noise ratio; systole; two-dimensional imaging; validation process; aorta; biological model; diagnostic imaging; flow kinetics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; Aorta; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Cardiovascular; Rheology","Annio, G.; Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, United Kingdom; email: anniogiacomo@gmail.com

However, problems with skeletal muscle oxygen extraction have not been fully investigated. This study used cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CMR-CPET) to simultaneously measure oxygen consumption and cardiac output. This allowed calculation of arteriovenous oxygen content gradient, a recognized marker of oxygen extraction. We performed CMR-CPET in 4 groups: systemic sclerosis (SSc); systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc-PAH); non-connective tissue disease pulmonary hypertension (NC-PAH); and healthy controls. Methods: We performed CMR-CPET in 60 subjects (15 in each group) using a supine ergometer following a ramped exercise protocol until exhaustion. Values for oxygen consumption, cardiac output and oxygen content gradient, as well as ventricular volumes, were obtained at rest and peak-exercise for all subjects. In addition, T1 and T2 maps were acquired at rest, and the most recent clinical measures (hemoglobin, lung function, 6-min walk, cardiac and catheterization) were collected. Results: All patient groups had reduced peak oxygen consumption compared to healthy controls (p < 0.022). The SSc and SSc-PAH groups had reduced peak oxygen content gradient compared to healthy controls (p < 0.03). Conversely, the SSc-PAH and NC-PH patients had reduced peak cardiac output compared to healthy controls and SSc patients (p < 0.006). Higher hemoglobin was associated with higher peak oxygen content gradient (p = 0.025) and higher myocardial T1 was associated with lower peak stroke volume (p = 0.011). Conclusions: Reduced peak oxygen consumption in SSc patients is predominantly driven by reduced oxygen content gradient and in SSc-PAH patients this was amplified by reduced peak cardiac output.

Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions. Methods: The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefited from the Bibliometrix R software package. Results: The investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths. Conclusions: The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered. For instance, AI projects require skills and data quality awareness for data-intensive analysis and knowledge-based management. Insights can help researchers and health professionals understand and address future research on AI in the healthcare field. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Clinical decision-making; Healthcare; Management; Patient data","artificial intelligence; China; clinical decision making; health care delivery; human; United Kingdom; Artificial Intelligence; China; Clinical Decision-Making; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; United Kingdom","Calandra, D.; Department of Management, Italy; email: davide.calandra@unito.it",,"BioMed Central Ltd",14726947,,,"33836752","English","BMC Med.

Target spatial and temporal resolutions require high acceleration rates often leading to long reconstruction times. Here we propose a deep artifact suppression framework for fast and accurate flow quantification. Methods: U-Nets were trained for deep artifact suppression using 520 breath-hold gated spiral PCMR aortic datasets collected in congenital heart disease patients. Two spiral trajectories (uniform and perturbed) and two losses (Mean Absolute Error -MAE- and average structural similarity index measurement -SSIM-) were compared in synthetic data in terms of MAE, peak SNR (PSNR) and SSIM. Perturbed spiral PCMR was prospectively acquired in 20 patients. Stroke Volume (SV), peak mean velocity and edge sharpness measurements were compared to Compressed Sensing (CS) and Cartesian reference. Results: In synthetic data, perturbed spiral consistently outperformed uniform spiral for the different image metrics. U-Net MAE showed better MAE and PSNR while U-Net SSIM showed higher SSIM based metrics. In-vivo, there were no significant differences in SV between any of the real-time reconstructions and the reference standard Cartesian data. However, U-Net SSIM had better image sharpness and lower biases for peak velocity when compared to U-Net MAE. Reconstruction of 96 frames took ~59 s for CS and 3.9 s for U-Nets.

Here we report the first case series of patients transplanted with ABO-IA, and compare outcomes with those undergoing plasma exchange facilitated ABO-incompatible heart transplantation (ABO-PE). Methods: Data were retrospectively analysed on all ABO-incompatible heart transplants undertaken at a single centre between January 1, 2000 and June 1, 2020. Data included all routine laboratory tests, demographics and pre-operative characteristics, intraoperative details and post-operative outcomes. Primary outcome measures were volume of blood product transfusions, maximum post-transplant isohaemagglutinin titres, occurrence of rejection and graft survival. Secondary outcome measures were length of intensive care and hospital stay. Demographic and survival data were also obtained for ABO-compatible transplants during the same time period for comparison. Results: Thirty-seven patients underwent ABO-incompatible heart transplantation, with 27 (73%) using ABO-PE and 10 (27%) using ABO-IA. ABO-IA patients were significantly older than ABO-PE patients (p < 0.001) and the total volume of blood products transfused during the hospital admission was significantly lower (164 [126-212] ml/kg vs 323 [268-379] ml/kg, p < 0.001). No significant differences were noted between methods in either pre or post-transplant maximum isohaemagglutinin titres, incidence of rejection, length of intensive care or total hospital stay. Survival comparison showed no significant difference between antibody reduction methods, or indeed ABO-compatible transplants (p = 0.6). Conclusions: This novel technique appears to allow a significantly older population than typical to undergo ABO-incompatible heart transplantation, as well as significantly reducing blood product utilization. Furthermore, intraoperative anti-A/B immunoadsorption does not demonstrate increased early post-transplant isohaemagglutinin accumulation or rates of rejection compared to ABO-PE. Early survival is equivalent between ABO-IA, ABO-PE and ABO-compatible heart transplantation. © 2021 The Authors","cardiopulmonary bypass; heart transplantation; immunoadsorption; pediatrics","basiliximab; hemagglutinin; methylprednisolone; mycophenolate mofetil; prednisolone; tacrolimus; antibody; adolescent; adult; Article; blood; blood group ABO incompatibility; blood transfusion; child; clinical article; clinical outcome; female; graft survival; heart transplantation; hospitalization; human; immunoadsorption; intraoperative period; male; outcome assessment; preoperative period; preschool child; retrospective study; blood group ABO system; blood group incompatibility; complication; follow up; graft rejection; heart transplantation; immunology; infant; peroperative care; plasmapheresis; procedures; ABO Blood-Group System; Antibodies; Blood Group Incompatibility; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Graft Rejection; Graft Survival; Heart Transplantation; Humans; Infant; Intraoperative Care; Male; Plasmapheresis; Retrospective Studies","Issitt, R.; Perfusion Department, United Kingdom; email: richard.issitt@gosh.nhs.uk",,"Elsevier Inc.",10532498,,JHLTE,"34187714","English","J.

Real-time acquisitions often require iterative image reconstruction strategies, which lead to long reconstruction times. In this study, we aim to reconstruct highly undersampled radial real-time data with low latency using deep learning. Methods: A 2D U-Net with convolutional long short-term memory layers is proposed to exploit spatial and preceding temporal information to reconstruct highly accelerated tiny golden radial data with low latency. The network was trained using a dataset of breath-hold CINE data (including 770 time series from 7 different orientations). Synthetic paired data were created by retrospectively undersampling the magnitude images, and the network was trained to recover the target images. In the spirit of interventional imaging, the network was trained and tested for varying acceleration rates and orientations. Data were prospectively acquired and reconstructed in real time in 1 healthy subject interactively and in 3 patients who underwent catheterization. Images were visually compared to sliding window and compressed sensing reconstructions and a conventional Cartesian real-time sequence. Results: The proposed network generalized well to different acceleration rates and unseen orientations for all considered metrics in simulated data (less than 4% reduction in structural similarity index compared to similar acceleration and orientation-specific networks). The proposed reconstruction was demonstrated interactively, successfully depicting catheters in vivo with low latency (39 ms, including 19 ms for deep artifact suppression) and an image quality comparing favorably to other reconstructions. Conclusion: Deep artifact suppression was successfully demonstrated in the time-critical application of non-Cartesian real-time interventional cardiac MR. © 2021 The Authors.

However, gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) carry a risk of dose-related adverse effects. Purpose: To develop a deep learning method to reduce GBCA dose by 80%. Study Type: Retrospective and prospective. Population: A total of 1157 retrospective and 40 prospective congenital heart disease patients for training/validation and testing, respectively. Field Strength/Sequence: A 1.5 T, T1-weighted three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo. Assessment: A neural network was trained to enhance low-dose (LD) 3D MRA using retrospective synthetic data and tested with prospective LD data. Image quality for LD (LD-MRA), enhanced LD (ELD-MRA), and high-dose (HD-MRA) was assessed in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and a quantitative measure of edge sharpness and scored for perceptual sharpness and contrast on a 1–5 scale. Diagnostic confidence was assessed on a 1–3 scale. LD- and ELD-MRA were assessed against HD-MRA for sensitivity/specificity and agreement of vessel diameter measurements (aorta and pulmonary arteries). Statistical Tests: SNR, CNR, edge sharpness, and vessel diameters were compared between LD-, ELD-, and HD-MRA using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance with post-hoc t-tests. Perceptual quality and diagnostic confidence were compared using Friedman's test with post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Sensitivity/specificity was compared using McNemar's test. Agreement of vessel diameters was assessed using Bland–Altman analysis. Results: SNR, CNR, edge sharpness, perceptual sharpness, and perceptual contrast were lower (P &lt; 0.05) for LD-MRA compared to ELD-MRA and HD-MRA. SNR, CNR, edge sharpness, and perceptual contrast were comparable between ELD and HD-MRA, but perceptual sharpness was significantly lower. Sensitivity/specificity was 0.824/0.921 for LD-MRA and 0.882/0.960 for ELD-MRA. Diagnostic confidence was 2.72, 2.85, and 2.92 for LD, ELD, and HD-MRA, respectively (PLD-ELD, PLD-HD &lt; 0.05). Vessel diameter measurements were comparable, with biases of 0.238 (LD-MRA) and 0.278 mm (ELD-MRA). Data Conclusion: Deep learning can improve contrast in LD cardiovascular MRA.

We aimed to evaluate our thresholding technique in a group of patients with LVNC and assess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scans of patients with Petersen criteria LVNC and quantified noncompacted myocardial mass. We assessed the association of noncompacted myocardial mass, CMR derived LV volumetric parameters and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) to MACCE including cardiac death, cardiac transplantation, sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) and ischemic stroke. Patients with known genetic mutations and cardiovascular disease were excluded. Results: 98 patients with LVNC were included (55 males,56.7%); 17(17.3%) patients had impaired LV function and five (5.1%) had LGE. Patients with impaired LV function had more end-systolic noncompacted mass (61.9 g±22.4 vs. 38.1 g±15.8, p < 0.001) and larger end-systolic noncompacted to total myocardial mass (44%±9 vs. 36%±12, p = 0.003). At 78 months follow-up [interquartile range(IQR) 66–90], MACCE occurred in 11(11.3%) patients; nine(81.8%) had impaired LV function and two(18.2%) had LGE. Impaired LV function and LV LGE were predictors of MACCE (HR = 35.6, 95% CI = 7.65–165.21, p < 0.001 and HR = 16.2, 95% CI = 4.54–57.84, p < 0.001) whereas noncompacted mass were not. Conclusion: Noncompacted mass was not an independent predictor of major adverse events but in patients with impaired LV function and/or LV LGE, the risk of MACCE was high. These results highlight the importance of including LV volumetrics and scar in the assessment of patients with LV noncompaction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cardiac magnetic resonance; Left ventricular non-compaction; Myocardial mass; Relative signal intensity","gadobutrol; contrast medium; gadolinium; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cerebrovascular disease; clinical outcome; contrast enhancement; controlled study; female; follow up; heart death; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle volume; heart transplantation; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; ischemic stroke; major clinical study; male; prediction; retrospective study; ventricular noncompaction; cardiac muscle; cine magnetic resonance imaging; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; predictive value; ventricular noncompaction; Adult; Contrast Media; Gadolinium; Humans; Isolated Noncompaction of the Ventricular Myocardium; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Myocardium; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Ventricular Function, Left","Femia, G.502/2 Roseby Street, Australia; email: femia82@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01675273,,IJCDD,"33309759","English","Int.

This study aimed to estimate postoperative central venous pressure in patients with total cavopulmonary connection using data routinely collected during preoperative assessment. We sought to determine if this metric correlated with measured postoperative central venous pressure and if it was associated with early Fontan failure. Methods: In this retrospective study, central venous pressure in total cavopulmonary connection was estimated in 131 patients undergoing pre–total cavopulmonary connection assessment by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and central venous pressure measurement under general anesthesia. Postoperative central venous pressure during the first 24 hours in the intensive care unit was collected from electronic patient records in a subset of patients. Early Fontan failure was defined as death, transplantation, total cavopulmonary connection takedown, or emergency fenestration within the first 30 days. Results: Estimated central venous pressure in total cavopulmonary connection correlated significantly with central venous pressure during the first 24 hours in the intensive care unit (r = 0.26, P =.03), particularly in patients without a fenestration (r = 0.45, P =.01). Central venous pressure in total cavopulmonary connection was significantly associated with early Fontan failure (odds ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.21; P =.03). A threshold of central venous pressure in total cavopulmonary connection 33 mm Hg or greater was found to have the highest specificity (90%) and sensitivity (58%) for identifying early Fontan failure (area under receiver operating curve = 0.73; odds ratio, 12.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-62.3; P =.002). This association was stronger in patients with single superior vena cava. Conclusions: Estimated central venous pressure in total cavopulmonary connection is an easily calculated metric combining preoperative pressure and flow data. Higher central venous pressure in total cavopulmonary connection is associated with an increased risk of early Fontan failure and is correlated with directly measured post–total cavopulmonary connection pressure.

However, it is an inherently slow imaging technique. Over the last 20 years, parallel imaging, temporal encoding and compressed sensing have enabled substantial speed-ups in the acquisition of MRI data, by accurately recovering missing lines of k-space data. However, clinical uptake of vastly accelerated acquisitions has been limited, in particular in compressed sensing, due to the time-consuming nature of the reconstructions and unnatural looking images. Following the success of machine learning in a wide range of imaging tasks, there has been a recent explosion in the use of machine learning in the field of MRI image reconstruction. A wide range of approaches have been proposed, which can be applied in k-space and/or image-space. Promising results have been demonstrated from a range of methods, enabling natural looking images and rapid computation.

Background: Greater cIMT is commonly used in the young as a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, but its evolution at this age is still poorly understood. Methods: Associations between cardiovascular risk factors and cIMT were investigated in both longitudinal (ages 9 to 17 years) and cross-sectional (ages 17 and 21 years) analyses, with the latter also related to other measures of carotid structure and stress. Additional use of ultra-high frequency ultrasound in the radial artery at age 21 years allowed investigation of the distinct layers (i.e., intima or media) that may underlie observed differences. Results: Fat-free mass (FFM) and systolic blood pressure were the only modifiable risk factors positively associated with cIMT (e.g., mean difference in cIMT per 1-SD increase in FFM at age 17: 0.007 mm: 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.004 to 0.010; p < 0.001), whereas fat mass was negatively associated with cIMT (difference: −0.0032; 95% CI: 0.004 to −0.001; p = 0.001). Similar results were obtained when investigating cumulative exposure to these factors throughout adolescence. An increase in cIMT maintained circumferential wall stress in the face of increased mean arterial pressure when increases in body mass were attributable to increased FFM, but not fat mass. Risk factor−associated differences in the radial artery occurred in the media alone, and there was little evidence of a relationship between intimal thickness and any risk factor. Conclusions: Subtle changes in cIMT in the young may predominantly involve the media and represent physiological adaptations as opposed to subclinical atherosclerosis. Other vascular measures may be more appropriate for the identification of arterial disease before adulthood. © 2021 The Authors","ALSPAC; fat-free mass; intima-media thickness; systolic blood pressure","adolescence; adolescent; adult; artery intima; artery media; Article; body mass; cardiovascular risk factor; carotid intima-media thickness; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; data analysis software; fat free mass; fat mass; female; high frequency ultrasound; human; longitudinal study; male; mean arterial pressure; priority journal; radial artery; systolic blood pressure; wall stress; young adult; arterial wall thickness; carotid artery; diagnostic imaging; predictive value; risk factor; Adolescent; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Young Adult","Deanfield, J.E.; UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, 1 St. Martin's Le Grand, United Kingdom; email: j.deanfield@ucl.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Inc.",1936878X,,,"31607674","English","JACC Cardiovasc.

Background: VA of first-pass stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may underestimate ischemia in MVCAD. Pixelwise perfusion mapping allows quantitative measurement of regional myocardial blood flow, which may improve ischemia detection in MVCAD. Methods: One hundred fifty-one subjects recruited at 2 centers underwent stress perfusion CMR with myocardial perfusion mapping, and invasive coronary angiography with coronary physiology assessment. Ischemic burden was assessed by VA of first-pass images and by quantitative measurement of stress myocardial blood flow using perfusion maps. Results: In patients with MVCAD (2-vessel [2VD] or 3-vessel disease [3VD]; n = 95), perfusion mapping identified significantly more segments with perfusion defects (median segments per patient 12 [interquartile range (IQR): 9 to 16] by mapping vs. 8 [IQR: 5 to 9.5] by VA; p < 0.001). Ischemic burden (IB) measured using mapping was higher in MVCAD compared with IB measured using VA (3VD mapping 100 % (75% to 100%) vs. first-pass 56% (38% to 81%); 2VD mapping 63% (50% to 75%) vs. first-pass 41% (31% to 50%); both p < 0.001), but there was no difference in single-vessel disease (mapping 25% (13% to 44%) vs. 25% (13% to 31%). Perfusion mapping was superior to VA for the correct identification of extent of coronary disease (78% vs. 58%; p < 0.001) due to better identification of 3VD (87% vs. 40%) and 2VD (71% vs. 48%). Conclusions: VA of first-pass stress perfusion underestimates ischemic burden in MVCAD. Pixelwise quantitative perfusion mapping increases the accuracy of CMR in correctly identifying extent of coronary disease. This has important implications for assessment of ischemia and therapeutic decision-making. © 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation","adenosine stress; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; coronary artery disease; myocardial blood flow","adenosine; gadoterate meglumine; sodium chloride; adenosine; adult; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical assessment; comparative study; controlled study; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease burden; female; heart beat; heart muscle blood flow; heart muscle perfusion; human; hyperemia; image analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; myocardial perfusion imaging; priority journal; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; coronary artery blood flow; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; fractional flow reserve; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; perfusion; predictive value; severity of illness index; Adenosine; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Circulation; Fractional Flow Reserve, Myocardial; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Myocardial Perfusion Imaging; Perfusion; Predictive Value of Tests; Severity of Illness Index","Fontana, M.; Department of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, Rowland Hill Street, United Kingdom; email: m.fontana@ucl.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Inc.",1936878X,,,"33011115","English","JACC Cardiovasc.

In this work, a free-breathing 3D whole-heart cine imaging framework was developed using a time-efficient stack of spirals trajectory and accelerated reconstruction. Two suitable view ordering methods are considered with different spacing between k-space readouts in the partition dimension: uniform and tiny golden ratio based. A simulation study suggested the latter did not present any benefits in terms of similarity to the true image. The proposed method was subsequently tested on 10 prospective subjects and compared with conventional multi-slice breath-hold imaging. Image quality was evaluated using objective and subjective scores and ventricular measurements were compared to assess clinical accuracy. Image quality was lower in the proposed technique than in breath-hold images but good agreement was found in clinically relevant ventricular measurements.

However, they have long acquisition times. Here, we propose significant speed-ups using a deep-learning single volume super-resolution reconstruction, to recover high-resolution features from rapidly acquired low-resolution WH-bSSFP images. Methods: A 3D residual U-Net was trained using synthetic data, created from a library of 500 high-resolution WH-bSSFP images by simulating 50% slice resolution and 50% phase resolution. The trained network was validated with 25 synthetic test data sets. Additionally, prospective low-resolution data and high-resolution data were acquired in 40 patients. In the prospective data, vessel diameters, quantitative and qualitative image quality, and diagnostic scoring was compared between the low-resolution, super-resolution and reference high-resolution WH-bSSFP data. Results: The synthetic test data showed a significant increase in image quality of the low-resolution images after super-resolution reconstruction. Prospectively acquired low-resolution data was acquired ~× 3 faster than the prospective high-resolution data (173 s vs 488 s). Super-resolution reconstruction of the low-resolution data took < 1 s per volume. Qualitative image scores showed super-resolved images had better edge sharpness, fewer residual artefacts and less image distortion than low-resolution images, with similar scores to high-resolution data. Quantitative image scores showed super-resolved images had significantly better edge sharpness than low-resolution or high-resolution images, with significantly better signal-to-noise ratio than high-resolution data. Vessel diameters measurements showed over-estimation in the low-resolution measurements, compared to the high-resolution data. No significant differences and no bias was found in the super-resolution measurements in any of the great vessels. However, a small but significant for the underestimation was found in the proximal left coronary artery diameter measurement from super-resolution data. Diagnostic scoring showed that although super-resolution did not improve accuracy of diagnosis, it did improve diagnostic confidence compared to low-resolution imaging. Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the potential of using a residual U-Net for super-resolution reconstruction of rapidly acquired low-resolution whole heart bSSFP data within a clinical setting. We were able to train the network using synthetic training data from retrospective high-resolution whole heart data. The resulting network can be applied very quickly, making these techniques particularly appealing within busy clinical workflow. Thus, we believe that this technique may help speed up whole heart CMR in clinical practice. © 2020 The Author(s).","Convolutional neural network; Machine learning; Rapid imaging; Super-resolution; Whole-heart imaging","adult; artery diameter; article; artifact; clinical article; clinical practice; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; great blood vessel; human; image quality; left coronary artery; male; prospective study; signal noise ratio; steady state; velocity; workflow; adolescent; aged; child; computer assisted diagnosis; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; heart; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; predictive value; preschool child; reproducibility; time factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Deep Learning; Female; Heart; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Workflow; Young Adult","Steeden, J.A.; UCL Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, 30 Guildford Street, United Kingdom; email: jennifer.steeden@ucl.ac.uk",,"BioMed Central Ltd",10976647,,JCMRF,"32753047","English","J.

A commonly used uniform density spiral and a new ‘perturbed’ spiral that produces more incoherent aliases were assessed. The aim was to ascertain whether greater incoherence enabled more accurate Compressive Sensing reconstruction and superior measurement of flow and velocity. Methods: A range of ‘perturbed’ spiral trajectories based on a uniform spiral trajectory were formulated. The trajectory that produced the most noise-like aliases was selected for further testing. For in-silico and in-vivo experiments, data was reconstructed using total Variation L1 regularisation in the spatial and temporal domains. In-silico, the reconstruction accuracy of the ‘perturbed’ golden spiral was compared to uniform density golden-angle spiral. For the in-vivo experiment, stroke volume and peak mean velocity were measured in 20 children using ‘perturbed’ and uniform density golden-angle spiral sequences. These were compared to a reference standard gated Cartesian sequence. Results: In-silico, the perturbed spiral acquisition produced more accurate reconstructions with less temporal blurring (NRMSE ranging from 0.03 to 0.05) than the uniform density acquisition (NRMSE ranging from 0.06 to 0.12). This translated in more accurate results in-vivo with no significant bias in the peak mean velocity (bias: −0.1, limits: −4.4 to 4.1 cm/s; P = 0.98) or stroke volume (bias: −1.8, limits: −9.4 to 5.8 ml, P = 0.19). Conclusion: We showed that a ‘perturbed’ golden-angle spiral approach is better suited to Compressive Sensing reconstruction due to more incoherent aliases. This enabled accurate real-time measurement of flow and peak velocity in children. © 2019 The Authors.

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting The study was conducted at two university medical centres, located in Berlin and London. Participants A total of 121 patients with aortic coarctation (ages 1-71 years) underwent cardiac MRI, echocardiography and blood pressure measurements. Outcome measures Cross-sectional diameters of the ascending and descending aortas were assessed to compute aortic area distensibility. Findings were compared with age-specific reference values. The study complied with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement and reporting guidelines. Results Impaired distensibility (below fifth percentile) was seen in 37% of all patients with coarctation in the ascending aorta and in 43% in the descending aorta. BAVD (43%) and arterial hypertension (72%) were present across all ages. In patients >10 years distensibility impairment of the ascending aorta was predominantly associated with BAVD (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.33 to 7.22, p=0.009). Distensibility impairment of the descending aorta was predominantly associated with arterial hypertension (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.08 to 7.2, p=0.033) and was most pronounced in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite antihypertensive treatment. Conclusion From early adolescence on, both arterial hypertension and BAVD have a major impact on aortic distensibility. Their specific effects differ in strength and localisation (descending vs ascending aorta). Moreover, adequate blood pressure control is associated with improved distensibility. These findings could contribute to the understanding of cardiovascular complications and the management of patients with aortic coarctation. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

This could negatively affect the normal cardiovascular response to food ingestion, where mesenteric vasodilation and a concurrent rise in CO are central. We sought to elucidate this using rapid cardiovascular MRI. Thirty fasting subjects (50% controls, 40% women and 60% men) ingested a standardized meal. Responses over ~50 min in mean arterial pressure (MAP), CO, and blood flow in all major aortic branches were measured, and regional vascular impedance (Z0) was calculated. Differences from baseline and between groups were assessed by repeated-measures mixed models. Compared with the control group, the Fontan patient group had greater fasting Z0 of the legs and kidneys, resulting in greater systemic Z0 and similar MAP. They further had similar blood flow to the digestive organs at baseline, despite larger variation in mesenteric resistance. Postprandially, blood flow to the legs decreased in the control group but not in the Fontan patient group. Increases in CO and superior mesenteric blood flow were similar in both groups, but the celiac response was blunted in the Fontan patient group. No significant differences in MAP responses were observed. In conclusion, alterations in vascular tone to counteract adverse hemodynamics and raised hepatic afterload may blunt vasoreactivity in the legs and the celiac axis in Fontan physiology. Further study is needed to determine whether blunted celiac or mesenteric vasoreactivity is linked to deteriorating hemodynamics and poor prognosis in Fontan patients. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Novel data on cardiovascular physiology in response to a meal in Fontan patients are presented. Using a previously validated dynamic MRI protocol, we demonstrated that the usual increase in cardiac output and the dilation of the superior mesenteric artery are preserved in clinically well Fontan patients. In contrast, vasoconstriction of the legs may have prevented redistribution of blood flow from this region in response to the meal. This may also affect responses to other types of stress. Celiac vasodilation was also absent in Fontan patients. This may be due to abnormal hepatic circulation. The proposed protocol may be used to study Fontan complications secondary to abnormal regional hemodynamics. © 2020 the American Physiological Society","Blood flow; Fontan; Magnetic resonance imagine; Postprandial; Vascular physiology","adolescent; adult; artery resistance; Article; blood flow; cardiovascular response; clinical assessment; controlled study; fasting; female; fontanel; food intake; heart afterload; heart output; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; male; mean arterial pressure; mesenteric artery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; postprandial state; priority journal; case control study; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; eating; Fontan procedure; hemodynamics; pathophysiology; predictive value; splanchnic blood flow; time factor; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Eating; Female; Fontan Procedure; Heart Defects, Congenital; Hemodynamics; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Postprandial Period; Predictive Value of Tests; Splanchnic Circulation; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","Hauser, J.A.; Centre for Translational Cardiovascular Imaging, United Kingdom; email: jakob.hauser@ucl.ac.uk",,"American Physiological Society",03636135,,AJPPD,"32857602","English","Am.

In addition to providing detailed diagnostic data, these methods have the potential to simulate patient-specific interventions and to predict their outcome. Our objective was to evaluate to which extent patient-specific modelling influences treatment decisions in coarctation of the aorta (CoA), a common congenital heart disease. We selected three cases with CoA, two of which had borderline indications for intervention according to current clinical guidelines. The third case was not indicated for intervention according to guidelines. For each case, we generated two separate datasets. First dataset included conventional diagnostic parameters (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging). In the second, we added modelled parameters (pressure fields). For the two cases with borderline indications for intervention, the second dataset also included pressure fields after virtual stenting simulations. All parameters were computed by modelling methods that were previously validated. In an online-administered, invitation-only survey, we randomized 178 paediatric cardiologists to view either conventional (control) or add-on modelling (experimental) datasets. Primary endpoint was the proportion of participants recommending different therapeutic options: (1) surgery or catheter lab (collectively, “intervention”) or (2) no intervention (follow-up with or without medication). Availability of data from computational predictive modelling influenced therapeutic decision making in two of three cases. There was a statistically significant association between group assignment and the recommendation of an intervention for one borderline case and one non-borderline case: 94.3% vs. 72.2% (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.14–1.50, p = 0.00) and 18.8% vs. 5.1% (RR: 3.09, 95% CI: 1.17–8.18, p = 0.01) of participants in the experimental and control groups respectively recommended an intervention. For the remaining case, there was no difference between the experimental and control group and the majority of participants recommended intervention. In sub-group analyses, findings were not affected by the experience level of participating cardiologists. Despite existing clinical guidelines, the therapy recommendations of the participating physicians were heterogeneous. Validated patient-specific computational modelling has the potential to influence treatment decisions.

However, LV mass can vary in response to changes in myocyte volume, edema, or fibrosis. The aims of this study were to investigate the acute changes in structural (myocardial mass and biventricular volumes) and tissue characterization parameters (native T1 and T2) following HD using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Twenty-five stable HD patients underwent non-contrast CMR including volumetric assessment and native T1 and T2 mapping immediately pre- and post-HD. The mean time between the first and second scan was 9.1 ± 1.1 hours and mean time from completion of dialysis to the second scan was 3.5 ± 1.3 hours. Post-HD, there was reduction in LV mass (pre-dialysis 98.9 ± 36.9 g/m2 vs post-dialysis 93.3 ± 35.8 g/m2, p = 0.003), which correlated with change in body weight (r = 0.717, p &lt; 0.001). Both native T1 and T2 reduced significantly following HD (Native T1: pre-dialysis 1085 ± 43 ms, post-dialysis 1072 ± 43 ms; T2: pre-dialysis 53.3 ± 3.0 ms, post-dialysis 51.8 ± 3.1 ms, both p &lt; 0.05). These changes presumably reflect acute reduction in myocardial water content rather than regression of LV hypertrophy. CMR with multiparametric mapping is a promising tool to assess the cardiac changes associated with HD. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"body weight; cardiac muscle; female; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle; hemodialysis; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; pathophysiology; reproducibility; Body Weight; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Organ Size; Renal Dialysis; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke Volume","Fontana, M.; Royal Free HospitalUnited Kingdom; email: m.fontana@ucl.ac.uk",,"Nature Publishing Group",20452322,,,"30718606","English","Sci.

Although linked to obesity and hypertension, its pathogenesis is multifactorial. Blunted postprandial sympathetic regulation of gut blood flow has been observed in overweight animals and suggested as a promotor of hypertension and LVH. We hypothesized that blunted postprandial superior mesenteric blood flow responses would be more common in overweight humans and associated with increased blood pressure and LVH. METHODS: Left ventricular dimensions and hemodynamic responses to a standardized high-calorie liquid meal were measured in healthy adolescents (n=82; 39 overweight/obese) by magnetic resonance imaging. Covariates such as body mass index, blood pressure, Tanner score, and an index of insulin resistance were included in multiple regression models to examine the independent associations of mesenteric flow response with blood pressure status and LVH. RESULTS: Food ingestion increased cardiac output (Δmean, 0.45 [SD, 0.62] L·min-1; P=3.8×10-8) and superior mesenteric artery flow (Δmean, 0.76 [SD, 0.35] L·min-1; P=4.2×10-31). A blunted mesenteric flow response was associated with increased left ventricular mass (B=-12.7 g·m-2.7 per L·min-1·m-0.92; P=6×10-5) and concentric LVH (log likelihood, -9.9; P=0.001), independently of known determinants of LVH, including body mass index. It was also associated with elevated systolic blood pressure (B=-18.0 mm Hg per L·min-1·m-0.92; P=0.001), but this link did not explain the association with left ventricular mass. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial mesenteric vascular dysfunction is associated with LVH and hypertension, independently of common risk factors for those conditions. These findings highlight a new, independent marker of cardiovascular risk in the young.","hypertension; hypertrophy; magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; vascular diseases","adolescent; blood pressure; body mass; cine magnetic resonance imaging; complication; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; female; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart ventricle; heart ventricle remodeling; human; male; mesenteric artery; normal human; obesity; pathophysiology; physiology; postprandial state; procedures; risk factor; young adult; Adiposity; Adolescent; Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Echocardiography; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Mesenteric Arteries; Obesity; Postprandial Period; Risk Factors; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Remodeling; Young Adult",,,"NLM (Medline)",19420080,,,"31707792","English","Circ Cardiovasc Imaging",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074742108

CMR-guided right heart catheterization (CMR-RHC) combines the benefits of CMR and invasive cardiac catheterization, but its feasibility in patients with acquired PAH has not been established. The aims of this study are to: (1) demonstrate the feasibility of CMR-RHC in patients being assessed for PAH in a conventional diagnostic CMR scanner room; (2) determine the predictors of (i) procedure duration, and (ii) procedural failure or technical difficulty as determined by the adjunctive need for a guidewire. Methods: Fifty patients investigated for suspected or known PH underwent CMR-RHC. Durations of separate procedural components were recorded, including time taken to pass the catheter from the femoral vein to a stable wedge position (procedure time) and total time the patient spent in the CMR department (department time). Associations between procedural failure/guidewire usage and hemodynamic/CMR measures were assessed using logistic regression. Relationships between procedure times and hemodynamic/CMR measures were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: A full CMR-RHC study was successfully completed in 47 (94%) patients. CMR-conditional guidewires were used in 6 (12%) patients. Metrics associated with guidewire use/procedural failure were higher mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressures (mPAP: OR = 1.125, p = 0.018), right heart dilatation (right ventricular (RV) end-systolic volume (RVESV): OR = 1.028, p = 0.018), RV hypertrophy (OR = 1.050, p = 0.0067) and RV ejection fraction (EF) (OR = 0.914, p = 0.014). Median catheter and department times were 3.6 (2.0-7.7) minutes and 60.0 (54.0-68.5) minutes, respectively. All procedure times became significantly shorter with increasing procedural experience (p < 0.05). Catheterization time was also associated with PH severity (RV systolic pressure: rho = 0.46, p = 0.0013) and increasing RV end-systolic volume (RVESV: rho = 0.41, p = 0.0043), hypertrophy (rho = 0.43, p = 0.0025) and dysfunction (RVEF: rho = - 0.32, p = 0.031). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that CMR-RHC using standard technology can be incorporated into routine clinical practice for the investigation of PAH. Procedural failure was rare but more likely in patients with severe PAH. Procedure time is clinically acceptable and increases with worsening PAH severity. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging; Guidewire; Interventional cardiovascular MR catheterization; Pulmonary hypertension; Right heart catheterization","adult; adverse event; aged; arterial pressure; diagnostic imaging; feasibility study; female; heart catheterization; human; interventional magnetic resonance imaging; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; prognosis; pulmonary artery; pulmonary hypertension; time factor; very elderly; workflow; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arterial Pressure; Cardiac Catheterization; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension; Pulmonary Artery; Time Factors; Workflow; Young Adult","Muthurangu, V.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, 30 Guilford Street, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",10976647,,JCMRF,"31495338","English","J.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to better characterize both cardiac and vascular phenotype in children with hypertension. Objective: To use MRI to determine the cardiac and vascular phenotypes of different forms of treated hypertension and compare the results with those of healthy children. Materials and methods: Sixty children (15 with chronic renal disease with hypertension, 15 with renovascular hypertension, 15 with essential hypertension and 15 healthy subjects) underwent MRI with noninvasive blood pressure measurements. Cardiovascular parameters measured include systemic vascular resistance, total arterial compliance, left ventricular mass and volumetric data, ejection fraction and myocardial velocity. Between-group comparisons were used to investigate differences in the hypertension types. Results: Renal hypertension was associated with elevated vascular resistance (P≤0.007) and normal arterial compliance. Conversely, children with essential hypertension had normal resistance but increased compliance (P=0.001). Renovascular hypertension was associated with both increased resistance and compliance (P≤0.03). There was no difference in ventricular volumes, mass or cardiac output between groups. Children with renal hypertension also had lower systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Conclusion: Cardiovascular MRI may identify distinct vascular and cardiac phenotypes in different forms of treated childhood hypertension. Future studies are needed to investigate how this may inform further optimisation of blood pressure treatment in different types of hypertension. © 2019, The Author(s).","Aortic stiffness; Child; Chronic kidney disease; Hypertension; Magnetic resonance imaging; Renal artery stenosis; Systemic vascular resistance","angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; antihypertensive therapy; aortic flow; artery compliance; Article; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; child; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; essential hypertension; female; heart ejection fraction; heart left ventricle mass; heart left ventricle outflow tract; heart left ventricle volume; heart output; heart stroke volume; human; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; myocardial velocity; non invasive measurement; priority journal; renovascular hypertension; school child; systemic vascular resistance; systolic blood pressure; vascular resistance; adolescent; aorta; blood flow velocity; case control study; diagnostic imaging; heart ventricle; hypertension; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; phenotype; procedures; renovascular hypertension; respiratory gated imaging; Adolescent; Aorta; Blood Flow Velocity; Case-Control Studies; Child; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Hypertension; Hypertension, Renovascular; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Phenotype; Respiratory-Gated Imaging Techniques; Stroke Volume; Vascular Resistance","Muthurangu, V.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, 30 Guilford Street London, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,"Springer Verlag",03010449,,PDRYA,"31053874","English","Pediatr.

Background: Cardiac involvement in light chain and transthyretin amyloidosis is the main driver of prognosis and influences treatment strategies. Numerous measures of cardiac structure and function are assessed by multiple imaging modalities in amyloidosis. Methods: A total f 322 subjects (311 systemic amyloidosis and 11 transthyretin gene mutation carriers) underwent comprehensive CMR and transthoracic echocardiography. The probabilities of 11 commonly measured structural and functional cardiac parameters being abnormal with increasing cardiac amyloidosis burden were evaluated. Cardiac amyloidosis burden was quantified using CMR-derived extracellular volume. The prognostic capacities of these parameters to predict death in amyloidosis were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Left ventricular mass and mitral annular plane systolic excursion by CMR along with strain and E/e’ by echocardiography have high probabilities of being abnormal at low cardiac amyloid burden. Reductions in biventricular ejection fractions and elevations in biatrial areas occur at high burdens of infiltration. The probabilities of indexed stroke volume, myocardial contraction fraction, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) being abnormal occur more gradually with increasing extracellular volume. Ninety patients (28%) died during a median follow-up of 22 months (interquartile range: 10 to 38 months). Univariable analysis showed that all imaging markers studied significantly predicted outcome. Multivariable analysis showed that TAPSE (hazard ratio: 1.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.85; p < 0.01) and indexed stroke volume (hazard ratio: 1.24; 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.48; p < 0.05) by CMR were the only independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions: Specific functional and structural abnormalities characterize different burdens of cardiac amyloid deposition. In a multimodality imaging assessment of a large cohort of amyloidosis patients, CMR-derived TAPSE and indexed stroke volume are the strongest prognostic cardiac functional markers. © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation","amyloidosis; CMR; echocardiography; function; prognosis","amyloid; transthyretin; amyloid; adult; aged; amyloidosis; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular mortality; cross-sectional study; disease burden; extracellular space; female; follow up; gene mutation; heart amyloidosis; heart contraction; heart ejection fraction; heart function; heart left ventricle mass; heart stroke volume; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prognosis; transthoracic echocardiography; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion; AL amyloidosis; cardiac muscle; cardiomyopathy; chemistry; cine magnetic resonance imaging; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; familial amyloid polyneuropathy; middle aged; mortality; pathology; pathophysiology; predictive value; prognosis; pulsed Doppler echocardiography; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; severity of illness index; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Amyloid; Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial; Cardiomyopathies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Echocardiography, Doppler, Pulsed; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin Light-chain Amyloidosis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index","Fontana, M.; Centre for Amyloidosis & Acute Phase Proteins, Rowland Hill Street, United Kingdom; email: m.fontana@ucl.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Inc.",1936878X,,,"29680336","English","JACC Cardiovasc.

However, previous studies have not demonstrated a consistent relationship between shape and vascular load. In this study, 3D aortic shape was evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA), allowing investigation of the relationship between 3D shape and haemodynamics. Methods: Sixty subjects (38 male, 25.0 ± 7.8 years) with repaired coarctation were recruited. Central aortic haemodynamics including wave intensity analysis were measured noninvasively using a combination of blood pressure and phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). 3D curvature and radius data were derived from CMR angiograms. PCA was separately performed on 3D radius and curvature data to assess the role of arch geometry on haemodynamics. Clinical findings were corroborated using 1D vascular models. Results: There were no independent associations between 3D curvature and any hemodynamic parameters. However, the magnitude of the backwards compression wave was related to the 1st (r = - 0.36, p = 0.005), 3rd (r = 0.27, p = 0.036) and 4th (r = - 0.31, p = 0.017) principle components of radius. The 4th principle componentof radius also correlated with central aortic systolic pressure. These aortas had larger aortic roots, more transverse arch hypoplasia and narrower aortic isthmuses. Conclusions: There are major modes of variation in 3D aortic shape after coarctation repair witha modest association between variation in aortic radius and pathological wave reflections, but not with 3D curvature. Taken together, these data suggest that shape is not the major determinant of vascular load following coarctation repair, and calibre is more important than curvature. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Coarctation of the aorta; Congenital heart disease; Hemodynamics; Hypertension","adult; angiography; aortic coarctation; aortic reconstruction; aortic root; aortic systolic pressure; arterial hemodynamics; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; female; hemodynamics; human; hypoplasia; major clinical study; male; non invasive procedure; priority journal; systolic blood pressure; adolescent; aortic coarctation; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; magnetic resonance angiography; pathophysiology; predictive value; principal component analysis; reproducibility; retrospective study; thoracic aorta; treatment outcome; young adult; contrast medium; gadoterate meglumine; meglumine; organometallic compound; Adolescent; Adult; Aorta, Thoracic; Aortic Coarctation; Contrast Media; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Meglumine; Organometallic Compounds; Predictive Value of Tests; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","Muthurangu, V.; Centre for Translational Cardiovascular Imaging, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",10976647,,JCMRF,"30975162","English","J.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the established reference, but cost, test duration, and patient discomfort are potential limitations to its serial use. We investigated whether an Abbreviated CMR protocol would alter clinical decisions in TOF from those that would have been made using a full protocol. Patients > 7 years with repaired TOF were identified. CMR was performed according to standard complete imaging protocol. CMRs were prepared in two ways, Full and Abbreviated and submitted for review by two imaging specialists. In conjunction with clinical information and case-specific quantitative CMR data (PR fraction, ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, branch pulmonary artery flow), Full and Abbreviated image sets were anonymized and uploaded for review. For the first half, Imager 1 received Abbreviated, and Imager 2 Full and for the remaining, Imager 1 received Full and Imager 2 received Abbreviated. Blinded to the other’s choices, Imagers provided clinical decisions. Inter-rater agreement for each decision was measured. In all, 124 studies from 80 patients (mean 17.8 years) were analyzed. For ‘intervention versus no-intervention’ decision, the inter-rater agreement was strong [κ 0.75, p < 0.0001, 95% CI (0.630, 0.869)]. Agreement for recommended timing of follow-up imaging was good (κ 0.64, p < 0.0001, 95% CI (0.474, 0.811)] in the ‘no-intervention’ group. When raters were asked whether or not further imaging was necessary, agreement was modest [κ 0.363 (p < 0.0001), 95% CI (0.038, 0.687)]. In conclusion, Abbreviated CMR yield decisions for clinical care similar to those made using the standard full protocol. These results suggest a potential enhancement of clinical practice in which efficiency and cost saving might be achieved using Abbreviated CMR for routine follow-up surveillance of TOF. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adult congenital heart disease; Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Pediatric cardiology; Tetralogy of Fallot","adolescent; adult; artery blood flow; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; clinical decision making; clinical decision support system; clinical protocol; controlled study; Fallot tetralogy; female; heart ejection fraction; heart ventricle volume; human; major clinical study; male; medical record review; pulmonary artery; pulmonary valve insufficiency; retrospective study; aftercare; cine magnetic resonance imaging; clinical decision making; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; Fallot tetralogy; heart; heart surgery; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aftercare; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Child; Clinical Decision-Making; Female; Heart; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Tetralogy of Fallot; Young Adult","Kutty, S.; Division of Pediatric Cardiology, 8200 Dodge St, United States; email: skutty@unmc.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",01720643,,PECAD,"30539240","English","Pediatr.

Residual convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown potential for removing artifacts caused by data undersampling. In this study, we investigated the ability of CNNs to reconstruct highly accelerated radial real-time data in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods: A 3D (2D plus time) CNN architecture was developed and trained using synthetic training data created from previously acquired breath hold cine images from 250 CHD patients. The trained CNN was then used to reconstruct actual real-time, tiny golden angle (tGA) radial SSFP data (13 × undersampled) acquired in 10 new patients with CHD. The same real-time data was also reconstructed with compressed sensing (CS) to compare image quality and reconstruction time. Ventricular volume measurements made using both the CNN and CS reconstructed images were compared to reference standard breath hold data. Results: It was feasible to train a CNN to remove artifact from highly undersampled radial real-time data. The overall reconstruction time with the CNN (including creation of aliased images) was shown to be >5 × faster than the CS reconstruction. In addition, the image quality and accuracy of biventricular volumes measured from the CNN reconstructed images were superior to the CS reconstructions. Conclusion: This article has demonstrated the potential for the use of a CNN for reconstruction of real-time radial data within the clinical setting. Clinical measures of ventricular volumes using real-time data with CNN reconstruction are not statistically significantly different from gold-standard, cardiac-gated, breath-hold techniques. © 2018 The Authors Magnetic Resonance in Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","convolutional neural network; deep artifact suppression; deep learning; real-time; ventricular volumes","Cardiology; Compressed sensing; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Diseases; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Artifact suppression; Compressive sensing; Congenital heart disease; Real time; Real-time assessment; Reconstructed image; Synthetic training data; ventricular volumes; Deep learning; adolescent; adult; Article; artifact reduction; artificial neural network; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; clinical article; compressed sensing; congenital heart disease; convolutional neural network; female; heart ventricle volume; human; image processing; image quality; image reconstruction; intermethod comparison; male; three dimensional imaging; algorithm; artifact; breath holding; breathing; cardiac gated imaging; cine magnetic resonance imaging; computer assisted diagnosis; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; Fourier analysis; heart; middle aged; procedures; retrospective study; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Artifacts; Breath Holding; Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques; Deep Learning; Fourier Analysis; Heart; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Respiration; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult","Muthurangu, V.; UCL Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc",07403194,,MRMEE,"30194880","English","Magn.

The aim was to demonstrate that GRASS acquisitions could be flexibly reconstructed as both cardiac-gated and time-resolved angiograms. Methods: Image quality of time-resolved and cardiac-gated reconstructions of the GRASS sequence were compared to 3 conventional stack of spirals (SoS) acquisitions in an in silico model. In 10 patients, the GRASS sequence was compared to conventional breath hold angiography (BH-MRA) in terms of image quality and for vessel measurement. Vessel measurements were also compared to cine images. Results: In the cardiac-gated in silico model, the image quality of GRASS was superior to regular and golden-angle with regular step SoS approaches. In the time-resolved model, GRASS image quality was comparable to the golden-angle with regular step technique and superior to regular SoS acquisitions. In patients, there was no difference in qualitative image scores between GRASS and BH-MRA, but SNR was lower. There was good agreement in vessel measurements between the GRASS reconstructions and conventional MR techniques (BH-MRA: 29.8 ± 5.6 mm, time-resolved GRASS-MRA: 29.9 ± 5.4 mm, SSFP diastolic: 29.4 ± 5.8 mm, cardiac-gated GRASS-MRA diastolic: 29.5 ± 5.5 mm, P > 0.87). Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the GRASS acquisition enables flexible reconstruction of the same raw data as both time-resolved and cardiac-gated volumes. This may enable better interrogation of anatomy in congenital heart disease. © 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","cardiac MRA; compressive sensing; free breathing; golden ratio","Cardiology; Diseases; Image quality; Signal to noise ratio; cardiac MRA; Compressive sensing; Congenital heart disease; Free breathing; Gated reconstruction; Golden ratio; Qualitative images; Vessel measurements; Heart; gadoterate meglumine; adolescent; adult; Article; breath holding; cardiac gated imaging; clinical article; computer model; congenital heart disease; contrast enhancement; controlled study; golden ratio stack of spirals; human; image quality; image reconstruction; intermethod comparison; magnetic resonance angiography; proof of concept; radiological parameters; algorithm; aorta; artifact; child; cine magnetic resonance imaging; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; diastole; image processing; intravenous drug administration; motion; procedures; reproducibility; signal noise ratio; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Algorithms; Aorta; Artifacts; Child; Diastole; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Infusions, Intravenous; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Motion; Reproducibility of Results; Signal-To-Noise Ratio","Kowalik, G.T.; UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, United Kingdom; email: grzegorz.kowalik.09@ucl.ac.uk",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc",07403194,,MRMEE,"29802643","English","Magn.

The requirement for high spatiotemporal resolution in children necessitates the use of highly accelerated imaging techniques. Methods: A novel real-time balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) spiral sequence reconstructed using Compressed Sensing (CS) was prospectively validated against the breath-hold clinical standard for assessment of ventricular volumes in 60 children with congenital heart disease. Qualitative image scoring, quantitative image quality, as well as evaluation of biventricular volumes was performed. Standard BH and real-time measures were compared using the paired t-test and agreement for volumetric measures were evaluated using Bland Altman analysis. Results: Acquisition time for the entire short axis stack (∼ 13 slices) using the spiral real-time technique was ∼ 20 s, compared to ∼ 348 s for the standard breath hold technique. Qualitative scores reflected more residual aliasing artefact (p < 0.001) and lower edge definition (p < 0.001) in spiral real-time images than standard breath hold images, with lower quantitative edge sharpness and estimates of image contrast (p < 0.001). There was a small but statistically significant (p < 0.05) overestimation of left ventricular (LV) end-systolic volume (1.0 ± 3.5 mL), and underestimation of LV end-diastolic volume (- 1.7 ± 4.6 mL), LV stroke volume (- 2.6 ± 4.8 mL) and LV ejection fraction (- 1.5 ± 3.0%) using the real-time technique. We also observed a small underestimation of right ventricular stroke volume (- 1.8 ± 4.9 mL) and ejection fraction (- 1.4 ± 3.7%) using the real-time imaging technique. No difference in inter-observer or intra-observer variability were observed between the BH and real-time sequences. Conclusions: Real-time bSSFP imaging using spiral trajectories combined with a compressed sensing reconstruction showed good agreement for quantification of biventricular metrics in children with heart disease, despite slightly lower image quality. This technique holds the potential for free breathing data acquisition, with significantly shorter scan times in children. © 2018 The Author(s).","Children; Compressed sensing; Congenital heart disease; Left ventricular volumes; Paediatric; Real-time; Right ventricular volumes; Spiral","adolescent; adult; aortic coarctation; aortic disease; Article; breath holding; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; congenital heart disease; contrast to noise ratio; Fallot tetralogy; family history; female; great vessels transposition; heart atrium septum defect; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle outflow tract obstruction; heart left ventricle stroke volume; heart left ventricle volume; heart right ventricle function; heart right ventricle stroke volume; heart right ventricle volume; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle septum defect; human; image analysis; image display; image processing; image quality; image reconstruction; major clinical study; male; observer variation; priority journal; pulmonary artery stenosis; pulmonary hypertension; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; school child; signal noise ratio; steady state; Student t test; sudden death; valvular heart disease; young adult; age; cine magnetic resonance imaging; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; prospective study; reproducibility; validation study; Adolescent; Age Factors; Breath Holding; Child; Female; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Function, Right","Muthurangu, V.; UCL Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, 30 Guildford Street, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",10976647,,JCMRF,"30518390","English","J.

Recall-by-Genotype (RbG) is an approach that enables the collection of precise phenotypic measures in smaller studies, while maintaining statistical power and ability for causal inference. Methods: In this study, we used a combination of conventional multivariable regression analysis, Mendelian randomization (MR), and subsample RbG methodologies to estimate the causal effect of BMI on gross-level and detailed cardiovascular health in healthy participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children at age 17 years (N=1420-3108 for different outcomes) and an independent sample from the same cohort (for RbG) study at age 21 years (N=386-418). Results: In both MR and RbG analyses, results suggested that higher BMI causes higher blood pressure and left ventricular mass index in young adults (eg, difference in left ventricular mass index per 1 kg/m2 using MR: 1.07 g/m2.7; 95% CI, 0.62-1.52; P=3.87×10-06 and per 3.58 kg/m2 using RbG: 1.65 g/m2.7; 95% CI, 0.83-2.47; P=0.0001). Additionally, RbG results suggested a causal role of higher BMI on higher stroke volume (difference per 3.58 kg/m2: 1.49 mL/m2.04; 95% CI, 0.62-2.35; P=0.001) and cardiac output (difference per 3.58 kg/m2: 0.11 L·min-1·m-1.83; 95% CI, 0.03-0.19; P=0.01) but no strong evidence for a causal role on systemic vascular resistance or total arterial compliance. Neither analysis supported a causal role of higher BMI on heart rate. Conclusions: Complementary MR and RbG causal methodologies, together with a range of sensitivity analyses, suggest that higher BMI is likely to cause worse cardiovascular health, specifically higher blood pressure and left ventricular mass index, even in youth. Higher BMI also resulted in increased cardiac output in the RbG study, which appeared to be solely driven by stroke volume, as neither MR nor RbG analyses suggested a causal effect of BMI on heart rate. These consistent results support efforts to reduce BMI from a young age to prevent later adverse cardiovascular health and illustrate the potential for phenotypic resolution with maintained analytic power using RbG. © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Recently, we were able to show arterial stiffness, measured by invasive pulse wave velocity (IPWV), seems to be an excellent predictor for blood pressure response. However, given the invasiveness, IPWV is less suitable as a selection criterion for patients undergoing RDN. Consequently, we aimed to investigate the value of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) based measures of arterial stiffness in predicting the outcome of RDN compared to IPWV as reference. Methods: Patients underwent CMR prior to RDN to assess ascending aortic distensibility (AAD), total arterial compliance (TAC), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). In a second step, central aortic blood pressure was estimated from ascending aortic area change and flow sequences and used to re-calculate total arterial compliance (cTAC). Additionally, IPWV was acquired. Results: Thirty-two patients (24 responders and 8 non-responders) were available for analysis. AAD, TAC and cTAC were higher in responders, IPWV was higher in non-responders. SVR was not different between the groups. Patients with AAD, cTAC or TAC above median and IPWV below median had significantly better BP response. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves predicting blood pressure response for IPWV, AAD, cTAC and TAC revealed areas under the curve of 0.849, 0.828, 0.776 and 0.753 (p = 0.004, 0.006, 0.021 and 0.035). Conclusions: Beyond IPWV, AAD, cTAC and TAC appear as useful outcome predictors for RDN in patients with hypertension. CMR-derived markers of arterial stiffness might serve as non-invasive selection criteria for RDN. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aortic distensibility; Arterial stiffness; Pulse wave velocity; Renal sympathetic denervation; Therapy resistant hypertension","adult; arterial stiffness; artery compliance; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; female; heart denervation; human; male; middle aged; receiver operating characteristic; renal sympathetic denervation; resistant hypertension; systemic vascular resistance; aorta; blood flow velocity; blood pressure; blood pressure monitoring; cine magnetic resonance imaging; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; follow up; hypertension; innervation; kidney; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; pulse wave; retrospective study; sympathectomy; Aorta; Blood Flow Velocity; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension; Kidney; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Pulse Wave Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Sympathectomy; Vascular Stiffness","Lurz, P.; Department of Internal Medicine/Cardiology, Strümpellstraße 39, Germany; email: Philipp.Lurz@medizin.uni-leipzig.de",,"Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag GmbH and Co.

Identifying high-risk children who may benefit from further therapeutic intervention is difficult as cardiovascular abnormalities are subtle. Although transthoracic echocardiography may be used to detect sub-clinical abnormalities, it has well-known problems with reproducibility that limit its ability to accurately detect these changes. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the reference standard method for assessing blood flow, cardiac structure and function. Furthermore, recent innovations enable the assessment of radial and longitudinal myocardial velocity, such that detection of sub-clinical changes is now possible. Thus, CMR may be ideal for cardiovascular assessment in pediatric CKD. This study aims to comprehensively assess cardiovascular function in pediatric CKD using CMR and determine its relationship with CKD severity. Methods: A total of 120 children (40 mild, 40 moderate, 20 severe pre-dialysis CKD subjects and 20 healthy controls) underwent CMR with non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurements. Cardiovascular parameters measured included systemic vascular resistance (SVR), total arterial compliance (TAC), left ventricular (LV) structure, ejection fraction (EF), cardiac timings, radial and longitudinal systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Between group comparisons and regression modelling were used to identify abnormalities in CKD and determine the effects of renal severity on myocardial function. Results: The elevation in mean BP in CKD was accompanied by significantly increased afterload (SVR), without evidence of arterial stiffness (TAC) or increased fluid overload. Left ventricular volumes and global function were not abnormal in CKD. However, there was evidence of LV remodelling, prolongation of isovolumic relaxation time and reduced systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Conclusion: Abnormal cardiovascular function is evident in pre-dialysis pediatric CKD. Novel CMR biomarkers may be useful for the detection of subtle abnormalities in this population. Further studies are needed to determine to prognostic value of these biomarkers. © 2018 The Author(s).","Arterial stiffness; Chronic renal failure; Hypertension; Myocardial impairment; Pediatrics; Systemic vascular resistance","biological marker; artery compliance; Article; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; child; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; disease severity; female; heart afterload; heart ejection fraction; heart function; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle volume; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prognosis; systemic vascular resistance; adolescent; age; blood vessel; cardiovascular disease; case control study; chronic kidney failure; complication; diagnostic imaging; glomerulus filtration rate; heart; heart contraction; heart ventricle remodeling; hemodynamics; kidney; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; phenotype; predictive value; risk factor; severity of illness index; Adolescent; Age Factors; Blood Vessels; Cardiovascular Diseases; Case-Control Studies; Child; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Heart; Hemodynamics; Humans; Kidney; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myocardial Contraction; Phenotype; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Remodeling","Muthurangu, V.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, 30 Guilford Street, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",10976647,,JCMRF,"29609642","English","J.

Liossi, C., University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom","Background: In addition to pain, sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) complications include neurocognitive difficulties in attention and processing speed associated with low daytime and night-time oxygen saturation compounded by obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In the general population OSA is treated with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP). The aim of this single-blind, randomised, controlled phase II trial is to compare auto-adjusting CPAP (APAP) with standard care to standard care alone in individuals with HbSS to determine whether the intervention improves attention and processing speed, brain structure, pain and quality of life. Methods/Design: Eligibility criteria include: ability to provide informed consent; age>8years; diagnosis of HbSS; and mean overnight saturation of<90% for<30% of the night (i.e. not meeting current criteria for overnight oxygen therapy). Key exclusion criteria are: overnight respiratory support; respiratory or decompensated cardiac failure; chronic transfusion; or contraindications to APAP therapy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sixty individuals with HbSS (30 children and 30 adults) will be randomised to standard care+APAP or standard care alone for six months. Minimisation factors are: age group (8-11, 12-15, 16-22 and>23years); silent infarction on MRI; minimum overnight oxygen saturation>90% or<90%; and hydroxyurea use. For APAP individuals, the intervention is administered at home. Adherence and effectiveness are recorded using software documenting hours of use each night and overnight oximetry. Participant support in terms of appropriate facemask and facilitating adherence are provided by an unblinded sleep physiologist. The primary outcome is change in the cancellation subtest from the Wechsler scales. Secondary outcomes include general cognitive functioning, quantitative brain MRI, blood and urine chemistry, quality of life and daily pain via a smartphone App (GoMedSolutions, Inc) and, where possible MRI heart, echocardiography, and 6-min walk. These outcomes will be assessed at baseline and after six months of treatment by assessors blind to treatment assignment. Discussion: Altering oxygen saturation in HbSS may lead to bone marrow suppression. This risk will be reduced by monitoring full blood counts at baseline, two weeks, three months and six months, providing treatment as appropriate and reporting as safety events.

However, despite its proved feasibility in paediatric patients, clinical utility has not been demonstrated. Therefore, this study aims to establish the role of adenosine stress perfusion CMR as a screening test in paediatric patients with acquired or congenital CAD. Methods and results A total of 58 paediatric patients underwent 61 consecutive clinically indicated coronary artery assessments for diagnostic and clinical decision-making purposes. The diagnosis was based on X-ray or computed tomography coronary angiography for anatomy, adenosine stress CMR imaging for myocardial perfusion and LGE for tissue characterization. Two studies were aborted because of unwanted side effects of adenosine stress, thus 59 studies were completed in 56 patients [median age 14.1 years (interquartile range 10.9-16.2)]. When compared with coronary anatomical imaging, adenosine stress perfusion CMR performed as follows: sensitivity 100% (95% confidence interval, CI: 71.6-100%), specificity 98% (95% CI: 86.7-99.9%), positive predictive value (PPV) 92.9% (95% CI: 64.2-99.6%), and negative predictive value 100% (95% CI: 89.9-100%). Conclusion In paediatric CAD, adenosine stress perfusion CMR imaging is adequate as an initial, non-invasive screening test for the identification of significant coronary artery lesions, with anatomical imaging used to confirm the extent of the culprit lesion. © 2017 The Author.","Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, Adenosine perfusion imaging; Coronary artery disease; Paediatrics","adenosine; gadoterate meglumine; iohexol; adenosine; adolescent; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; childhood disease; clinical decision making; coronary angiography; coronary artery; coronary artery disease; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; major clinical study; male; nausea; pharmacologic stress testing; predictive value; priority journal; radiodiagnosis; sensitivity and specificity; supraventricular tachycardia; thorax pain; cine magnetic resonance imaging; cohort analysis; computed tomographic angiography; confidence interval; coronary artery blood flow; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; exercise test; image enhancement; myocardial perfusion imaging; pediatrics; physiology; preschool child; procedures; retrospective study; Adenosine; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Computed Tomography Angiography; Confidence Intervals; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Circulation; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Myocardial Perfusion Imaging; Pediatrics; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Retrospective Studies","Taylor, A.M.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, United Kingdom; email: a.taylor76@ucl.ac.uk",,"Oxford University Press",20472404,,,"27461210","English","Eur.

Although case series are reported, there are no randomized controlled studies in children. Methods We designed a randomized, crossover, controlled pilot study to determine safety and feasibility of intracoronary stem cell therapy in children. The primary safety end-point was freedom from death and transplantation or any complication that could be considered related to bone marrow injection or anesthesia (e.g., infection, malignancy, anaphylaxis, renal deterioration). Other end-points were magnetic resonance imaging measurements and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide. Participants included 10 children (mean age 7.2 years; range, 2.2–14.1 years; 6 boys) with cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association/Ross Classification II–IV). Patients were crossed over at 6 months. Results The original protocol was completed by 9 patients. The safety end-point was achieved in all. Ratio of the geometric means for treatment effect adjusting for baseline was assessed for end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV): 0.93 for EDV (95% confidence interval 0.88–0.99, p = 0.01), indicating EDV was on average 7% lower in patients after stem cell treatment, and 0.90 for ESV (95% confidence interval 0.82–1.00, p = 0.05), indicating ESV was on average 10% lower after stem cell treatment compared with placebo. The primary efficacy end-point ejection fraction was not met. Conclusions Bone marrow mononuclear cell therapy for cardiomyopathy is feasible and safe in children. Left ventricular volumes were significantly reduced 6 months after stem cell injection compared with placebo, which may reflect reverse remodeling. © 2017","autologous stem cells; bone marrow; heart failure; intracoronary injection; pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy","acetylsalicylic acid; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; captopril; carvedilol; digoxin; furosemide; lisinopril; perindopril; placebo; spironolactone; warfarin; adolescent; anaphylaxis; Article; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; bone marrow derived mononuclear cell; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; childhood disease; clinical article; congestive cardiomyopathy; controlled study; crossover procedure; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; feasibility study; female; heart catheterization; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; human; male; neurological complication; New York Heart Association class; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; patient safety; pilot study; preschool child; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; school child; seizure; autotransplantation; bone marrow cell; bone marrow transplantation; cine magnetic resonance imaging; congestive cardiomyopathy; cytology; diagnostic imaging; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle; heart ventricle remodeling; infant; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; stem cell transplantation; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Bone Marrow Cells; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Over Studies; Feasibility Studies; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Pilot Projects; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stroke Volume; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Remodeling","Burch, M.; Cardiology Department, United Kingdom; email: michael.burch@gosh.nhs.uk",,"Elsevier USA",10532498,,JHLTE,"28162930","English","J.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA), one of the most common congenital heart diseases, can be repaired with stenting but requires monitoring and subsequent interventions to detect and treat disease recurrence and aortic wall injuries. Avoidable costs associated with stenting in patients with CoA are unknown. Methods: We developed an economic model to calculate potentially avoidable costs in stenting treatment of CoA in the United Kingdom over 5 years. We calculated baseline costs for the intervention and potentially avoidable complications and follow-up interventions and compared these to the costs in hypothetical scenarios with improved treatment effectiveness and complication rates. Results: Baseline costs were £16 688 ($25 182) per patient. Avoidable costs ranged from £137 ($207) per patient in a scenario assuming a 10% reduction in aortic wall injuries and reinterventions at follow-up, to £1627 ($2455) in a Best-case scenario with 100% treatment success and no complications. Overall costs in the Best-case scenario were 90.2% of overall costs at Baseline. Reintervention rate at follow-up was identified as most influential lever for overall costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a considerable degree of uncertainty for avoidable costs with widely overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Conclusions: Significant improvements in the treatment effectiveness and reductions in complication rates are required to realize discernible cost savings. Up to 10% of total baseline costs could be avoided in the best-case scenario.

Background: Evaluating systolic and diastolic dysfunctions in children is challenging, and a gold standard method is currently lacking. Methods: Patients with presumed diastolic dysfunction [n = 18; nine aortic stenosis (AS), five hypertrophic, and four restrictive cardiomyopathies] were compared with age-matched control subjects (n = 18). All patients had no mitral or aortic incompetence, significant AS, or reduced systolic EF. E/A ratio, E/E' ratio, deceleration time, and isovolumetric contraction time were assessed on echocardiography, and indexed left atrial volume (LAVi), acceleration time (AT), ejection time (ET), and wave intensity analyses were calculated from CMR. The latter was performed on CMR phase-contrast flow sequences, defining a ratio of the peaks of the early systolic forward compression wave (FCW) and the end-systolic forward expansion wave (FEW). Results: Significant differences between patients and controls were seen in the E/E' ratio (8.7 ± 4.0 vs. 5.1 ± 1.3, p = 0.001) and FCW/FEW ratio (2.5 ± 1.6 vs. 7.2 ± 4.2 × 10-5 m/s, p &lt; 0.001), as well as-as expected-LAVi (80.7 ± 22.5 vs. 51.0 ± 10.9 mL/m2, p &lt; 0.001). In particular, patients exhibited a lower FCW (2.5 ± 1.6 vs. 7.2 ± 4.2 × 10-5 m/s, p &lt; 0.001) in the face of preserved EF (67 ± 11 vs. 69 ± 5%, p = 0.392), as well as longer isovolumetric contraction time (49 ± 7 vs. 34 ± 7 ms, p &lt; 0.001) and ET/AT (0.35 ± 0.04 vs. 0.27 ± 0.04, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study shows that the wave intensity-derived ratio summarizing systolic and diastolic function could provide insight into ventricular function in children, on top of CMR and echocardiography, and it was here able to identify an element of ventricular dysfunction with preserved EF in a small group of young patients. © 2017 Ntsinjana, Chung, Ciliberti, Muthurangu, Schievano, Marek, Parker, Taylor and Biglino.","Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Diastolic function; Systolic function; Ventricular mechanics; Wave intensity analysis",,"Taylor, A.M.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, United Kingdom; email: a.taylor76@ucl.ac.uk",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",22962360,,,,"English","Front.

Methods and results Seventy-two patients (61% after Norwood operation) undergoing BCPC between 2007 and 2012 were assessed pre-operatively using echocardiography and CMR. Bland-Altman analysis and correlation coefficients were used for comparison of echocardiography and CMR measurements. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated to assess the ability of echocardiography to detect vessel stenosis. Twenty-four percent of all vessel measurements could not be made by echocardiography due to poor image quality. Acquisition of unsatisfactory images was higher in non-sedated patients. Although there was a reasonable correlation (0.68-0.90) and low bias (-0.8 to 0.5), there were wide limits of agreement between echocardiography and CMR demonstrating poor agreement. Sensitivity and specificity for pulmonary branches were moderate [sensitivity for right pulmonary artery (RPA) 67%, left pulmonary artery (LPA) 54%, specificity for RPA 65%, LPA 72%] with low levels of accuracy (RPA and LPA 42%). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were better for aorta (82, 86, and 63%, respectively). Conclusion This study demonstrates modest agreement between echocardiographic and CMR measures of vessel diameter and stenosis detection. Approximately a quarter of all vessel segments could not be measured using echocardiography due to poor image quality, which was significantly lower in non-sedated patients. These findings show that echocardiography cannot substitute CMR for reliable identification of great vessel stenoses in complex patients prior to the BCPC, particularly those with Blalock-Taussig shunts. © 2016 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.","bidirectional cavopulmonary connection; echocardiography; magnetic resonance","gadoterate meglumine; aorta; aortopulmonary shunt; artery diameter; Article; atrioventricular septal defect; Blalock Taussig shunt; blood vessel diameter; blood vessel occlusion; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cavopulmonary connection; child; computer assisted tomography; congenital heart disease; correlation coefficient; criss cross atrioventricular relationship; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; double inlet ventricle; echocardiography; Glenn shunt; great blood vessel; great vessels transposition; heart right ventricle double outlet; human; hypoplastic left heart syndrome; image quality; infant; intermethod comparison; lung artery banding; major clinical study; measurement; Norwood procedure; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; predictive value; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; pulmonary artery; pulmonary artery stenosis; pulmonary valve atresia; pulmonary valve stenosis; real time ultrasound scanner; reliability; retrospective study; right atrial isomerism; right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit; sensitivity and specificity; Shone syndrome; tricuspid valve atresia; cine magnetic resonance imaging; cohort analysis; comparative study; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; female; follow up; Fontan procedure; male; newborn; pathology; preoperative care; procedures; risk assessment; thoracic aorta; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; Aorta, Thoracic; Cohort Studies; Echocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Fontan Procedure; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Preoperative Care; Pulmonary Artery; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Treatment Outcome; United Kingdom","Marek, J.; Cardiorespiratory Unit, Great Ormond Street, United Kingdom; email: jan.marek@gosh.nhs.uk",,"Oxford University Press",20472404,,,"27099275","English","Eur.

We have developed a novel cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol that allows assessment of central hemodynamics, including central aortic systolic blood pressure, resistance, total arterial compliance, pulse wave velocity, and wave reflections. The main study aims were to (1) characterize group differences in central aortic systolic blood pressure and peripheral systolic blood pressure, (2) comprehensively evaluate afterload (including wave reflections) in the 2 groups, and (3) identify possible biomarkers among covariates associated with elevated left ventricular mass (LVM). Fifty adult patients with repaired coarctation and 25 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. Ascending aorta area and flow waveforms were obtained using a high temporal-resolution spiral phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance flow sequence. These data were used to derive central hemodynamics and to perform wave intensity analysis noninvasively. Covariates associated with LVM were assessed using multivariable linear regression analysis. There were no significant group differences (P≥0.1) in brachial systolic, mean, or diastolic BP. However central aortic systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in patients compared with controls (113 versus 107 mm Hg, P=0.002). Patients had reduced total arterial compliance, increased pulse wave velocity, and larger backward compression waves compared with controls. LVM index was significantly higher in patients than controls (72 versus 59 g/m 2, P<0.0005). The magnitude of the backward compression waves was independently associated with variation in LVM (P=0.01). Using a novel, noninvasive hemodynamic assessment, we have shown abnormal conduit vessel function after coarctation of the aorta repair, including abnormal wave reflections that are associated with elevated LVM. © 2017 The Authors.","blood pressure; congenital heart disease; hemodynamics; hypertension; magnetic resonance imaging","biological marker; adult; aorta coarctation; aorta reconstruction; artery compliance; artery resistance; Article; ascending aorta; blood pressure measurement; cardiac imaging; cardiac patient; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; comparative study; controlled study; digital imaging and communications in medicine; female; heart afterload; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart left ventricle mass; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; image processing; major clinical study; male; postoperative complication; priority journal; pulse wave; systolic blood pressure; young adult; adverse effects; aortic coarctation; blood pressure; diagnostic imaging; follow up; heart ventricle; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; magnetic resonance angiography; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative complication; pulse wave; time factor; vascular resistance; vascular surgery; Adult; Aortic Coarctation; Blood Pressure; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Postoperative Complications; Pulse Wave Analysis; Time Factors; Vascular Resistance; Vascular Surgical Procedures; Young Adult","Muthurangu, V.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, Great Ormond St, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",0194911X,,HPRTD,"28115510","English","Hypertension",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010858458

Sarcomeric components, including titin, undergo an isoform transition to adjust ventricular filling. Many sarcomeric genes have been implicated in congenital cardiomyopathies, such that understanding developmental sarcomere transitions will inform the aetiology and treatment. We sought to determine whether Thymosin β4 (Tβ4), a peptide that regulates the availability of actin monomers for polymerization in non-muscle cells, plays a role in sarcomere assembly during cardiac morphogenesis and influences adult cardiac function. In Tβ4 null mice, immunofluorescence-based sarcomere analyses revealed shortened thin filament, sarcomere and titin spring length in cardiomyocytes, associated with precocious up-regulation of the short titin isoforms during the postnatal splicing transition. By magnetic resonance imaging, this manifested as diminished stroke volume and limited contractile reserve in adult mice. Extrapolating to an in vitro cardiomyocyte model, the altered postnatal splicing was corrected with addition of synthetic Tβ4, whereby normal sarcomere length was restored. Our data suggest that Tβ4 is required for setting correct sarcomere length and for appropriate splicing of titin, not only in the heart but also in skeletal muscle. Distinguishing between thin filament extension and titin splicing as the primary defect is challenging, as these events are intimately linked. The regulation of titin splicing is a previously unrecognised role of Tβ4 and gives preliminary insight into a mechanism by which titin isoforms may be manipulated to correct cardiac dysfunction. © 2016 The Author(s)","Developmental splicing; Dysregulated sarcomere length; Thymosin β4; Titin isoforms","connectin; thymosin beta4; connectin; thymosin; thymosin beta(4); adult; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cardiac muscle cell; controlled study; embryo; enzyme regulation; heart stroke volume; in vitro study; limit of quantitation; male; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; perinatal period; priority journal; protein assembly; protein depletion; protein function; protein splicing; sarcomere length; upregulation; animal; cardiac muscle; deficiency; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; genetics; heart; heart contraction; hemodynamics; knockout mouse; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; RNA splicing; sarcomere; ultrastructure; Animals; Connectin; Echocardiography; Heart; Hemodynamics; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; RNA Splicing; Sarcomeres; Thymosin","Smart, N.; Department of Physiology, South Parks Road, United Kingdom; email: nicola.smart@dpag.ox.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",00222828,,JMCDA,"27914791","English","J.

We developed magnetic resonance (MR)-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing to achieve this goal and assessed children with right heart disease.METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy controls (n=10) and children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; n=10) and repaired tetralogy of Fallot (n=10) underwent MR-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing. All exercises were performed on an MR-compatible ergometer, and oxygen uptake was continuously acquired using a modified metabolic cart. Simultaneous cardiac output was measured using a real-time MR flow sequence and combined with oxygen uptake to calculate arteriovenous oxygen content difference. Peak oxygen uptake was significantly lower in the PAH group (12.6±1.31 mL/kg per minute; P=0.01) and trended toward lower in the tetralogy of Fallot group (13.5±1.29 mL/kg per minute; P=0.06) compared with controls (16.7±1.37 mL/kg per minute). Although tetralogy of Fallot patients had the largest increase in cardiac output, they had lower resting (3±1.2 L/min per m2) and peak (5.3±1.2 L/min per m2) values compared with controls (resting 4.3±1.2 L/min per m2 and peak 6.6±1.2 L/min per m2) and PAH patients (resting 4.5±1.1 L/min per m2 and peak 5.9±1.1 L/min per m2). Both the PAH and tetralogy of Fallot patients had blunted exercise-induced increases in arteriovenous oxygen content difference. However, only the PAH patients had significantly reduced peak values (6.9±1.3 mlO2/100 mL) compared with controls (8.4±1.4 mlO2/100 mL; P=0.005).CONCLUSIONS: MR-augmented cardiopulmonary exercise testing is feasible in both healthy children and children with cardiac disease.

Materials and Methods: The sequence was based on an efficient uniform density spiral acquisition, combined with data acceleration. A novel acquisition and reconstruction strategy enabled combination of UNFOLD (2×) and SENSE (3×): UNFOLD-ed SENSE. The sequence was retrospectively cardiac-gated, and a graphics processing unit (GPU) was used for rapid “online” reconstruction. The optimal UNFOLD parameters for the data were calculated using an in silico model. The technique was validated on a 1.5T MR scanner in 15 patients with known aortic valve disease, against a respiratory self-navigated free-breathing TPM technique. Quantitative image quality measures (velocity-to-noise and edge sharpness) were made as well as calculation of longitudinal, radial, and tangential myocardial velocities in the left ventricle. Results: The proposed breath-hold TPM data took eight heartbeats to acquire. The breath-hold TPM images had significantly higher edge sharpness (P = 0.0014) than the self-navigated TPM images, but with significantly lower velocity-to-noise ratio (P < 0.0001). There was excellent agreement (r > 0.94) in the longitudinal, radial, and tangential velocities between the self-navigated data and the proposed breath-hold TPM sequence. Conclusion: We demonstrate the feasibility of using spiral UNFOLD-ed SENSE to measure myocardial velocities using a rapid breath-hold spiral TPM sequence. This novel technique might enable accurate measurement of myocardial velocities, in a short scan time, which is especially important in a busy clinical workflow. J. MAGN. RESON.

This response is usually beneficial, improving the chance of overcoming environmental challenges, but costs resources such as energy. Humans and other animals are known to adapt their responses to acute stress when they are stimulated chronically, presumably to optimise resource utilisation. Characterisation of these adaptations has been limited. Using advanced imaging techniques, we show that cardiovascular and endocrine physiology, reflective of energy utilisation during acute stress, and energy storage (fat) differ between the sexes when they are exposed to chronic stress. We examine possible evolutionary explanations for these differences, related to energy use, and point out how these physiological differences could underpin known disparities between the sexes in their risk of important cardiometabolic disorders such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. Abstract: Obesity and associated diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, are the dominant human health problems in the modern era. Humans develop these conditions partly because they consume excess energy and exercise too little. Stress might be one of the factors contributing to these disease-promoting behaviours. We postulate that sex-specific primordial energy optimisation strategies exist, which developed to help cope with chronic stress but have become maladaptive in modern societies, worsening health. To demonstrate the existence of these energy optimisation strategies, we recruited 88 healthy adults with varying adiposity and chronic stress exposure. Cardiovascular physiology at rest and during acute stress (Montreal Imaging Stress Task), and body fat distribution were measured using advanced magnetic resonance imaging methods, together with endocrine function, cardiovascular energy use and cognitive performance. Potential confounders such as lifestyle, social class and employment were accounted for. We found that women exposed to chronic stress had lower adiposity, greater acute stress cardiovascular responses and better cognitive performance. Conversely, chronic stress-exposed men had greater adiposity and lower cardiovascular responses to acute stress. These results provide initial support for our hypothesis that differing sex-specific energy conservation strategies exist. We propose that these strategies have initially evolved to benefit humans but are now maladaptive and increase the risk of disorders such as obesity, especially in men exposed to chronic stress. © 2016 The Authors.

Invasive assessment of haemodynamics is crucial for accurate diagnosis and guidance of medical therapy. However, adequate imaging is increasingly important in children with PH to evaluate the right heart and the pulmonary vasculature. Cardiac MR (CMR) and computed tomography (CT) represent important non-invasive imaging modalities that may enable comprehensive assessment of right ventricular (RV) function and pulmonary haemodynamics. Here, we present graded consensus recommendations for the evaluation of children with PH by CMR and CT. The article provides a structured approach for the use of CMR and CT imaging, emphasises non-invasive variables of RV function, myocardial tissue and afterload parameters that may be useful for initial diagnosis and monitoring. Furthermore, assessment of pulmonary perfusion and characterisation of the lung parenchyma provides structural information about processes that may cause or be due to PH. © 2016 BMJ Publishing Group.

Methods The writing group members conducted searches of the PubMed/MEDLINE bibliographic database (1990–2015) and held five face-to-face meetings with votings. Clinical trials, guidelines, and reviews limited to paediatric data were searched using the terms ‘pulmonary hypertension’ and 5–10 other keywords, as outlined in the other nine articles of this special issue. Class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) were assigned based on European Society of Cardiology/American Heart Association definitions and on paediatric data only, or on adult studies that included >10% children. Results A total of 9 original consensus articles with graded recommendations (COR/LOE) were developed, and are summarised here. The topics included diagnosis/monitoring, genetics/biomarker, cardiac catheterisation, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance/chest CT, associated forms of PH, intensive care unit/ventricular assist device/lung transplantation, and treatment of paediatric PAH. Conclusions The multipaper expert consensus statement of the European Paediatric PVD Network provides a specific, comprehensive, detailed but practical framework for the optimal clinical care of children with PH. © 2016 BMJ Publishing Group.

This study devised a simple isometric exercise CMR methodology and assessed the hemodynamic response evoked by isometric exercise. Methods: A biceps isometric exercise technique was devised for CMR, and 75 healthy volunteers were assessed at rest, after 3-minute biceps exercise, and 5-minute of recovery using: 1) blood pressure (BP) and 2) CMR measured aortic flow and left ventricular function. Total peripheral resistance (SVR) and arterial compliance (TAC), cardiac output (CO), left ventricular volumes and function (ejection fraction, stroke volume, power output), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and rate pressure product were assessed at all time points. Results: Image quality was preserved during stress. During exercise there were increases in CO (+14.9 %), HR (+17.0 %), SVR (+9.8 %), systolic BP (+22.4 %), diastolic BP (+25.4 %) and mean BP (+23.2 %). In addition, there were decreases in TAC (-22.0 %) and left ventricular ejection fraction (-6.3 %). Age and body mass index modified the evoked response, even when resting measures were similar. Conclusions: Isometric exercise technique evokes a significant cardiovascular response in CMR, unmasking physiological differences that are not apparent at rest. Key points: • Isometric exercise unmasks cardiovascular differences not evident at rest. • CMR is the reference standard for non-invasive cardiovascular assessment at rest. • A new easily replicable method combines isometric exercise with CMR. • Significant haemodynamic changes occur and differences are unmasked. • The physiological, isometric CMR stressor can be easily replicated. © 2015, European Society of Radiology.","Cardiac imaging technique; Cardiovascular physiological processes; Exercise test; Isometric exercise; Magnetic resonance imaging","adult; age; aged; aorta flow; artery compliance; Article; biceps brachii muscle; blood pressure; body mass; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular response; controlled study; dynamometer; evoked response; female; heart hemodynamics; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle volume; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; human; image quality; isometric exercise; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; rest; sphygmomanometer; vascular resistance; adolescent; blood pressure measurement; Cardiovascular Diseases; evaluation study; exercise; exercise test; feasibility study; magnetic resonance angiography; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; sex difference; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blood Pressure Determination; Body Mass Index; Cardiac Output; Cardiovascular Diseases; Exercise; Exercise Test; Feasibility Studies; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Rest; Sex Factors; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Left; Young Adult","Mortensen, K.H.; UCL Centre for Cardiovascular MR, Great Ormond Street, United Kingdom; email: mortensen@doctors.org.uk",,"Springer Verlag",09387994,,EURAE,"26205639","English","Eur.

It is not clear whether this increased flow demand is compensated by a rise in cardiac output (CO) alone or by redistribution of blood flow from other organs. We used a new comprehensive imaging method to assess the human cardiovascular response to food ingestion. Following a 12-h fast, blood flow in segments of the aorta and in organspecific arteries, and ventricular volumes were assessed in 20 healthy adults using MRI at rest and following ingestion of a high-energy liquid meal. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) fell substantially and CO rose significantly. Blood pressure remained stable. These changes were predominantly driven by a rapid fall in mesenteric vascular resistance, resulting in over four times more intestinal blood flow. Renal vascular resistance also declined but less dramatically. No changes in blood flow to the celiac territory, the brain, or the limbs were observed. In conclusion, this is the first study to fully characterize systemic and regional changes in vascular resistance after food ingestion in humans. Our findings show that the postprandial drop in SVR is fully compensated for by increased CO and not by redistribution of blood from other organs. With the exception of a modest increase in renal blood flow, there was no evidence of altered blood flow to nondigestive organs. The proposed oral food challenge protocol can be applied safely in an MRI environment and may be useful for studying the involvement of the gut in systemic or cardiovascular disease. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.","Humans; Intestinal; MRI; Postprandial; Vascular resistance","adult; aorta flow; artery blood flow; Article; cardiovascular response; controlled study; female; food intake; heart output; heart ventricle volume; hemodynamic parameters; human; human experiment; intestine blood flow; kidney vascular resistance; male; mesentery blood flow; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; postprandial state; priority journal; systemic vascular resistance; adolescent; anatomy and histology; aorta; artery; blood; blood flow; blood vessel; caloric intake; eating; intestine; kidney circulation; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; vascular resistance; vascularization; young adult; carbon monoxide; Adolescent; Adult; Aorta; Arteries; Blood Vessels; Carbon Monoxide; Eating; Energy Intake; Female; Humans; Intestines; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Postprandial Period; Regional Blood Flow; Renal Circulation; Vascular Resistance; Young Adult","Hauser, J.A.; UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, 30 Guilford St, United Kingdom; email: jakob.hauser@ucl.ac.uk",,"American Physiological Society",03636119,,AJPRD,"26764056","English","Am.

Uncertainty exists on the factors contributing to this increased risk among which are the presence of (1) a residual narrowing leading to an additional resistance and (2) a less distensible zone disturbing the buffer function of the aorta. As the many interfering factors and adaptive physiological mechanisms present in vivo prohibit the study of the isolated impact of these individual factors, a numerical fluid–structure interaction model is developed to predict central hemodynamics in coarctation treatment. The overall impact of a stiffening on the hemodynamics is limited, with a small increase in systolic pressure (up to 8 mmHg) proximal to the stiffening which is amplified with increasing stiffening and length. A residual narrowing, on the other hand, affects the hemodynamics significantly. For a short segment (10 mm), the combination of a stiffening and narrowing (coarctation index 0.5) causes an increase in systolic pressure of 58 mmHg, with 31 mmHg due to narrowing and an additional 27 mmHg due to stiffening. For a longer segment (25 mm), an increase in systolic pressure of 50 mmHg is found, of which only 9 mmHg is due to stiffening. © 2015, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.","End-to-end anastomosis; Fluid–structure interaction; Image-based modeling; Stent","Blood vessels; Physiological models; Additional resistances; Aortic coarctation; End to end; Image-based modeling; Individual factors; Physiological mechanisms; Stent; Structure interactions; Hemodynamics; adult; aorta arch; aorta coarctation; aorta length; aorta pressure; aorta stenosis; arterial stiffness; artery diameter; artery occlusion; Article; ascending aorta; blood vessel parameters; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; comparative study; computational fluid dynamics; controlled study; deceleration; descending aorta; disease severity; flow rate; heart function; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; male; mathematical model; morbidity; normal human; pressure gradient; priority journal; scar; systole; systolic blood pressure; aortic coarctation; biological model; pathophysiology; pressure; Adult; Aortic Coarctation; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Models, Cardiovascular; Pressure; Vascular Stiffness","Taelman, L.; IBiTech-bioMMeda, De Pintelaan 185, Belgium; email: liesbeth.taelman@ugent.be",,"Springer Verlag",01400118,,MBECD,"26142885","English","Med.

To close this gap, we sought to demonstrate the usefulness of an additional non-invasive vascular profile. Method: During a pilot study in eight coarctation patients, aortic area compliance, aortic distensibility, time phase shift and blood flow (distribution) were calculated from cine-MRI and 2D-/4D-velocity-encoded MRI sequences. Results: Compared to healthy individuals, a significantly lower aortic compliance and reduced flow to the descending aorta were found in patients with coarctation. Discussion: These differences underline the potential usefulness of a combined vascular profile in coarctation patients. Conclusion: It was successfully shown that functional vascular profiling of the aorta is feasible to be acquired non-invasively in a clinical setting and can provide additional diagnostic information. These can be the key input parameters for computational fluid dynamics-modeling. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","aortic coarctation; aortic compliance; aortic perfusion; cardiac MRI; catheterization; congenital heart disease; disease modeling; vascular auto-regulation; Windkessel function","Computational fluid dynamics; Diagnosis; Aortic coarctation; Aortic compliance; aortic perfusion; Autoregulations; Cardiac MRI; catheterization; Congenital heart disease; Disease modeling; Windkessel; Blood vessels; iopromide; adolescent; adult; angiography device; aorta coarctation; aorta flow; artery compliance; artery dilatation; Article; blood pressure measurement; child; clinical article; controlled study; descending aorta; female; heart index; human; imaging software; male; non invasive blood pressure monitor; non invasive measurement; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; pilot study; school child; aorta; aortic coarctation; blood pressure; case control study; compliance (physical); coronary artery blood flow; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; procedures; thoracic aorta; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aorta; Aorta, Thoracic; Aortic Coarctation; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Case-Control Studies; Child; Compliance; Coronary Circulation; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Pilot Projects; Time Factors; Young Adult","Kelm, M.; German Heart Institute Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, Germany; email: mkelm@dhzb.de",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",17434440,,,"27227178","English","Expert Rev.

Therefore, right ventricular (RV) disease in pulmonary hypertension (PH) can result in abnormal left ventricular (LV) myocardial mechanics. To assess this, we implemented novel cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) tissue phase mapping (TPM) to assess radial, longitudinal and tangential LV myocardial velocities in patients with PH. Methods: Respiratory self-gated TPM was performed using a rotating golden-angle spiral acquisition with retrospective cardiac gating. TPM of a mid ventricular slice was acquired in 40 PH patients and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Endocardial and epicardial LV borders were manually defined, and myocardial velocities calculated using in-house software. Patients without proximal CTEPH (chronic thromboembolic PH) and not receiving intravenous prostacyclin therapy (n = 34) were followed up until the primary outcome of disease progression (death, transplantation, or progression to intravenous therapy) or the end of the study. Physicians who determined disease progression were blinded to CMR data. Conventional ventricular volumetric indices and novel TPM metrics were analyzed for prediction of 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and disease progression. Results: Peak longitudinal (p < 0.0001) and radial (p = 0.001) early diastolic (E) wave velocities were significantly lower in PH patients compared with healthy volunteers. Reversal of tangential E waves was observed in all patients and was highly discriminative for the presence of PH (p < 0.0001). The global radial E wave (β = 0.41, p = 0.017) and lateral wall radial systolic (S) wave velocities (β = 0.33, p = 0.028) were the only independent predictors of 6MWD in a model including RV ejection fraction (RVEF) and LV stroke volume. Over a median follow-up period of 20 months (IQR 7.9 months), 8 patients commenced intravenous therapy and 1 died. Global longitudinal E wave was the only independent predictor of clinical worsening (6.3× increased risk, p = 0.009) in a model including RVEF and septal curvature. Conclusions: TPM metrics of LV diastolic function are significantly abnormal in PH. More importantly, abnormal LV E wave velocities are the only independent predictors of functional capacity and clinical worsening in a model that includes conventional metrics of biventricular function. © 2015 Knight et al.","Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Diastolic dysfunction; Pulmonary hypertension","endothelin receptor antagonist; phosphodiesterase V inhibitor; prostacyclin; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; adult; Article; cardiac gated imaging; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; clinical article; controlled study; death; deterioration; disease course; exercise; female; functional status; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart stroke volume; human; left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; male; prediction; priority journal; pulmonary hypertension; walking; biomechanics; case control study; computer assisted diagnosis; diastole; feasibility study; heart left ventricle function; heart right ventricle function; Hypertension, Pulmonary; middle aged; mortality; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; prognosis; time factor; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Case-Control Studies; Diastole; Disease Progression; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Function, Right","Muthurangu, V.; UCL Medical School, Rowland Hill Street, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",10976647,,JCMRF,"26715551","English","J.

Materials and Methods: This HIPAA-compliant multicenter study was approved by institutional review boards of participating centers. All participants provided written informed consent. Participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis with cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) data were evaluated to quantify LV trabeculation as a fractal dimension (FD). Entire cohort participants free of cardiac disease, hypertrophy, hypertension, and diabetes were stratified by body mass index (BMI) into three reference groups (BMI ,25 kg/m2; BMI ?25 kg/m2 to ,30 kg/m2; and BMI ?30 kg/m2) to explore maximal apical FD (FDMaxApical). Multivariable linear regression models determined the relationship between FD and other parameters. Results: Included were 2547 participants (mean age, 68.7 years 6 9.1 [standard deviation]; 1211 men). FDMaxApical are in arbitrary units. FDMaxApical reference ranges for BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater (n = 163), 25 kg/m2 or greater to less than 30 kg/m2 (n = 206), and less than 25 kg/m2 (n = 235) were 1.203 6 0.06 (95% confidence interval: 1.194, 1.212), 1.194 6 0.06 (95% confidence interval: 1.186, 1.202), and 1.169 6 0.05 (95% confidence interval: 1.162, 1.176), respectively. In the entire cohort, adjusted for anthropometrics, trabeculation was higher in African American participants (standardized b [sb] = 0.09; P ? .001) and Hispanic participants (sb = 0.05; P = .013) compared with white participants and was also higher in African American participants compared with Chinese American participants (sb = 0.08; P = .01), and this persisted after adjustment for hypertension and LV size. Hypertension (sb = 0.07; P , .001), LV mass (sb = 0.22; P , .001), and wall thickness (sb = 0.27; P , .001) were positively associated with FDMaxApical even after adjustment. In the group with BMIs less than 25 kg/ m2, Chinese American participants had less trabeculation than white participants (sb = 20.15; P = .032). Conclusion: Fractal analysis of cardiac MR imaging data measures endocardial complexity, which helps to differentiate normal from abnormal trabecular patterns in healthy versus diseased hearts. Trabeculation is influenced by race and/or ethnicity and, more importantly, by cardiac loading conditions and comorbidities. Clinicians who interpret cine MR imaging data should expect slightly less endocardial complexity in Chinese American patients and more in African American patients, Hispanic patients, hypertensive patients, and those with hypertrophy. © RSNA, 2015.",,"adult; African American; aged; anthropometry; Article; Asian American; body mass; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cohort analysis; controlled study; ethnicity; female; fractal analysis; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle size; heart ventricle hypertrophy; Hispanic; human; hypertension; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; priority journal; atherosclerosis; cardiac muscle; Caucasian; cytology; ethnic group; genetic variation; heart ventricle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; African Americans; Anthropometry; Asian Americans; Atherosclerosis; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Genetic Variation; Heart Ventricles; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Myocardium","Moon, J.C.; Division of Cardiovascular Imaging and Biostatistics, 16-18 Westmoreland Street, United Kingdom; email: j.moon@ucl.ac.uk",,"Radiological Society of North America Inc.",00338419,,RADLA,"26069924","English","Radiology",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948777218

Methods and results: Clinically acquired images were used to set up patient-specific computational models for finite element (FE) and fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. The 3D geometry was reconstructed from computed tomography and echocardiography images. Computer-generated deployment of a CP covered stent (NuMED, Hopkinton, NY, USA) at different diameters was tested using FE simulations. CFD analyses based on preoperative magnetic resonance flow measurements allowed assessment of rCoA pressure relief and right subclavian artery perfusion in the different scenarios. The simulations suggested an expansion diameter for the CP stent (8 zigs, length=28 mm) of between 16 and 18 mm to relieve the obstruction, cover the aneurysm and maintain satisfactory flow to the right subclavian artery. Following the modelling study, a 16 mm CP covered stent was successfully implanted. Conclusions: Patient-specific models can be successfully used to plan re-stenting of complex rCoA, showing the benefits of integrating computational techniques into patient management. © Europa Digital & Publishing 2015.

A novel 2D echocardiographic technique for right ventricular (RV) quantitation involves knowledge-based reconstruction (KBR), a hybrid of 2D echocardiography-acquired coordinates localized in three-dimensional space and connected by reference to a disease-specific RV shape library. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of 2D KBR against cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in PH and the test-retest reproducibility of both conventional 2D echocardiographic RV fractional area change (FAC) and 2D KBR. Methods Twenty-eight patients with PH underwent same-day echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Two operators performed serial RV FAC and 2D KBR acquisition and postprocessing to assess inter- and intraobserver test-retest reproducibility. Results Bland-Altman analysis (mean bias ± 95% limits of agreement) showed good agreement for end-diastolic volume (3.5 ± 25.0 mL), end-systolic volume (0.9 ± 19.9 mL), stroke volume (2.6 ± 23.1 mL), and ejection fraction (0.4 ± 10.2%) measured by 2D KBR and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. There were no significant interobserver or intraobserver test-retest differences for 2D KBR RV metrics, with acceptable limits of agreement (interobserver end-diastolic volume, -0.9 ± 21.8 mL; end-systolic volume, -1.3 ± 25.8 mL; stroke volume, -0.2 ± 24.2 mL; ejection fraction, 0.7 ± 14.4%). Significant test-retest variability was observed for 2D echocardiographic RV areas and FAC. Conclusions Two-dimensional KBR is an accurate, novel technique for RV volumetric quantification in PH, with superior test-retest reproducibility compared with conventional 2D echocardiographic RV FAC. © 2015 American Society of Echocardiography.","Magnetic resonance imaging; Pulmonary hypertension; Reproducibility of results; Right ventricular function; Transthoracic echocardiography","adult; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; heart right ventricle; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart right ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart right ventricle endsystolic volume; heart stroke volume; human; image reconstruction; imaging software; male; measurement accuracy; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; prospective study; pulmonary hypertension; real time ultrasound scanner; reproducibility; test retest reproducibility; two dimensional echocardiography; two dimensional knowledge based volumetric reconstruction; complication; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; etiology; heart right ventricle function; knowledge base; observer variation; procedures; pulmonary hypertension; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Echocardiography; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Knowledge Bases; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ventricular Dysfunction, Right","Knight, D.S.; Division of Medicine, Rowland Hill Street, United Kingdom; email: danielknight@doctors.org.uk",,"Mosby Inc.",08947317,,JSECE,"25857546","English","J.

In this study we used pulmonary vessel area and flow obtained using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to implement WIA noninvasively. We hypothesized that this method could detect differences in reflections in PH patients compared with healthy controls and could also differentiate certain PH subtypes. Twenty patients with PH (35% CTEPH and 75% female) and 10 healthy controls (60% female) were recruited. Right and left pulmonary artery (LPA and RPA) flow and area curves were acquired using self-gated golden-angle, spiral, phase-contrast CMR with a 10.5-ms temporal resolution. These data were used to perform WIA on patients and controls. The presence of a proximal clot in CTEPH patients was determined from contemporaneous computed tomography/angiographic data. A backwards-traveling compression wave (BCW) was present in both LPA and RPA of all PH patients but was absent in all controls (P = 6e-8). The area under the BCW was associated with a sensitivity of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 63-100%] and specificity of 91% (95% CI 75-98%) for the presence of a clot in the proximal PAs of patients with CTEPH. In conclusion, WIA metrics were significantly different between patients and controls; in particular, the presence of an early BCW was specifically associated with PH. The magnitude of the area under the BCW showed discriminatory capacity for the presence of proximal PA clot in patients with CTEPH.

This study proposes a free-breathing (FB) time resolved MRA (TRA) technique for use in pediatric and adult congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods: A TRA sequence was developed by combining spiral trajectories with sensitivity encoding (SENSE, x4 kx-ky and x2 kz) and partial Fourier (75% in kz). As no temporal data sharing is used, an independent 3D data set was acquired every ∼1.3s, with acceptable spatial resolution (∼2.3x2.3x2.3mm). The technique was tested during FB over 50 consecutive volumes. Conventional BH-MRA and FB-TRA data was acquired in 45 adults and children with CHD. We calculated quantitative image quality for both sequences. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed in all patients from both sequences. Additionally, vessel measurements were made at the sinotubular junction (N = 43), proximal descending aorta (N = 43), descending aorta at the level of the diaphragm (N = 43), main pulmonary artery (N = 35), left pulmonary artery (N = 35) and the right pulmonary artery (N = 35). Intra and inter observer variability was assessed in a subset of 10 patients. Results: BH-MRA had significantly higher homogeneity in non-contrast enhancing tissue (coefficient of variance, P <0.0001), signal-to-noise ratio (P <0.0001), contrast-to-noise ratio (P <0.0001) and relative contrast (P = 0.02) compared to the FB-TRA images. However, homogeneity in the vessels was similar in both techniques (P = 0.52) and edge sharpness was significantly (P <0.0001) higher in FB-TRA compared to BH-MRA. BH-MRA provided overall diagnostic accuracy of 82%, and FB-TRA of 87%, with no statistical difference between the two sequences (P = 0.77). Vessel diameter measurements showed excellent agreement between the two techniques (r = 0.98, P <0.05), with no bias (0.0mm, P = 0.71), and clinically acceptable limits of agreement (-2.7 to +2.8mm). Inter and intra observer reproducibility showed good agreement of vessel diameters (r>0.988, P<0.0001), with negligible biases (between -0.2 and +0.1mm) and small limits of agreement (between -2.4 and +2.5mm). Conclusions: We have described a FB-TRA technique that is shown to enable accurate diagnosis and vessel measures compared to conventional BH-MRA. This simplifies the MRA technique and will enable angiography to be performed in children and adults whom find breath-holding difficult. © 2015 Steeden et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","3D stack-of-spirals; Congenital heart disease; Free-breathing; Time-resolved MR angiography","gadoterate meglumine; contrast medium; meglumine; organometallic compound; adolescent; adult; adult disease; aged; aorta coarctation; aorta subvalvular stenosis; arterial trunk; Article; breath holding; breathing; cardiac patient; child; childhood disease; clinical article; comparative study; congenital heart disease; congestive cardiomyopathy; contrast enhancement; contrast to noise ratio; controlled study; cor triatriatum; descending aorta; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diaphragm; Ebstein anomaly; Fallot tetralogy; female; great vessels transposition; heart atrium septum defect; heart right ventricle; heart ventricle septum defect; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; image quality; lung vein drainage anomaly; magnetic resonance angiography; male; Marfan syndrome; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; pulmonary artery; pulmonary valve stenosis; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; age; cardiac muscle; cardiomyopathy; computer assisted diagnosis; congenital heart malformation; coronary blood vessel; magnetic resonance angiography; middle aged; observer variation; pathology; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; three dimensional imaging; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiomyopathies; Child; Contrast Media; Coronary Vessels; Female; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Meglumine; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Observer Variation; Organometallic Compounds; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Respiration; Young Adult","Steeden, J.A.; UCL Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, 30 Guildford Street, United Kingdom",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",10976647,,JCMRF,"25997552","English","J.

Seventeen healthy adults underwent CPET and MR-CPET using an MR compatible ergometer and CPET system customised for MR use. Continuous aortic flow measurement used a validated UNFOLD-SENSE spiral phase contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) sequence. Fifteen of 17 volunteers completed exercise; exclusions were due to claustrophobia and inability to effectively master exercise technique. Measures of acceptability were lower but still satisfactory for MR-CPET. There were strong correlations between conventional and MR-CPET for peak VO2 (r = 0.94, p &lt; 0.001); VCO2 (r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001) and VE (r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated peak CO and ΔcO2 were independent predictors of peak VO2 measured during MR-CPET (β = 0.73 and 0.38 p &lt; 0.0001) and conventional CPET (β = 0.78, 0.28 p &lt; 0.0001). MR-CPET is feasible, acceptable and demonstrates physiology not apparent with conventional CPET. MR-CPET allows differentiation of the contributions of CO and ΔcO2 to variation in peak VO2. We believe that this will be useful in understanding the origin of reduced exercise capacity in cardiac disease. © 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","cardio pulmonary exercise test; CMR; exercise","Linear regression; Magnetic resonance; Oxygen; Aortic flow; Cardiac output; Cardio pulmonary exercise test; Cardiovascular function; CMR; Exercise; Exercise test; MR-compatible; Oxygen consumption; Peak values; Vanadium dioxide; adult; exercise test; feasibility study; female; heart output; human; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen consumption; procedures; Adult; Cardiac Output; Exercise Test; Feasibility Studies; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Oxygen Consumption",,,"IOP Publishing Ltd",09673334,,PMEAE,"25903482","English","Physiol.

Materials and Methods In 20 healthy volunteers RAGS ( ~6 sec breath-hold) and respiratory-navigated cine ( ~5 min) PCMR were performed in both renal arteries to assess RBF. A simulation of RAGS PCMR was used to assess the effect of heart rate (30-105 bpm), vessel expandability (0-150%) and translational motion (x1.0-4.0) on the accuracy of RBF measurements. Results There was good agreement between RAGS and cine PCMR in the volunteer study (bias: 0.01 L/min, limits of agreement: -0.04 to +0.06 L/min, P = 0.0001). The simulation demonstrated a positive linear relationship between heart rate and error (r = 0.9894, P < 0.0001), a negative linear relationship between vessel expansion and error (r = -0.9484, P < 0.0001), and a nonlinear, heart rate-dependent relationship between vessel translation and error. Conclusion We have demonstrated that RAGS PCMR accurately measures RBF in vivo. However, the simulation reveals limitations in this technique at extreme heart rates (<40 bpm, >100 bpm), or when there is significant motion (vessel expandability: >80%, vessel translation: >x2.2). © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","breath-hold; fast; flow; renal; spiral","adult; artery blood flow; Article; averaging; breath holding; computer simulation; contrast enhancement; female; flow measurement; heart movement; heart rate; human; human experiment; image analysis; image quality; kidney blood flow; male; measurement error; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; renal artery; RR interval; RR interval averaged golden angle spiral phase contrast magnetic resonance; signal noise ratio; algorithm; blood flow velocity; breath holding; cardiac gated imaging; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation study; kidney artery; kidney circulation; magnetic resonance angiography; middle aged; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; Adult; Algorithms; Blood Flow Velocity; Breath Holding; Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Artery; Renal Circulation; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity","Steeden, J.A.; UCL Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, United Kingdom",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",10531807,,JMRIF,"24723271","English","J.

We aimed to develop a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) based semi-automated technique for quantification of non-compacted (NC) and compacted (C) masses and to ascertain their relationships to global and regional LV function. Methods We analysed CMR data from 30 adults with isolated LVNC and 20 controls. NC and C masses were measured using relative signal intensities of myocardium and blood pool. Global and regional LVNC masses was calculated and correlated with both global and regional LV systolic function as well as occurrence of arrhythmia. Results LVNC patients had significantly higher end-systolic (ES) and end-diastolic (ED) NC:C ratios compared to controls (ES 0.21 [SD 0.09] vs. 0.12 [SD 0.02], p < 0.001; ED 0.39 [SD 0.08] vs. 0.26 [SD 0.05], p < 0.001). NC:C ratios correlated inversely with global ejection fraction, with a stronger correlation in ES vs. ED (r =-0.58, p < 0.001 vs. r =-0.30, p = 0.03). ES basal, mid and apical NC:C ratios also showed a significant inverse correlation with global LV ejection fraction (ES basal r =-0.29, p = 0.04; mid-ventricular r =-0.50, p < 0.001 and apical r =-0.71, p < 0.001). Upon ROC testing, an ES NC:C ratio of 0.16 had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 95% for detection of significant LVNC. Patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia had a significantly higher ES NC:C ratio (0.31 [SD 0.18] vs. 0.20 [SD 0.06], p = 0.02). Conclusions The NC:C ratio derived from relative signal intensities of myocardium and blood pool improves the ability to detect clinically relevant NC compared to previous CMR techniques. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Cardiomyopathy; Diagnostic criteria; Left ventricular non-compaction; Non-compaction cardiomyopathy","adult; Article; automation; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; female; functional assessment; heart arrhythmia; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; image analysis; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; process development; process optimization; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; syndrome delineation; ventricular noncompaction; cohort analysis; Isolated Noncompaction of the Ventricular Myocardium; metabolism; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; standards; Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Isolated Noncompaction of the Ventricular Myocardium; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged","Puranik, R.; Department of Cardiology, Australia; email: raj.puranik@cmrs.org.au",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01675273,,IJCDD,"25569272","English","Int.

Methods: The sequence utilized spiral trajectories with an acquisition strategy that allowed a combination of temporal encoding (Unaliasing by fourier-encoding the overlaps using the temporal dimension; UNFOLD) and parallel imaging (Sensitivity encoding; SENSE) to be used (UNFOLDed-SENSE). An in silico experiment was performed to determine the optimum UNFOLD filter. In vitro experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of time intervals calculation and peak mean velocity quantification. In addition, 15 healthy volunteers were imaged with the new sequence, and cardiac time intervals were compared to reference standard Doppler echocardiography measures. For comparison, in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments were also carried out using sliding window reconstructions. Results: The in vitro experiments demonstrated good agreement between real-time spiral UNFOLDed-SENSE phase contrast MR and the reference standard measurements of velocity and time intervals. The protocol was successfully performed in all volunteers. Subsequent measurement of time intervals produced values in keeping with literature values and good agreement with the gold standard echocardiography. Importantly, the proposed UNFOLDed-SENSE sequence outperformed the sliding window reconstructions. Conclusion: Cardiac time intervals can be successfully assessed with UNFOLDed-SENSE real-time spiral phase contrast.

Unlike disk summation three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography (3DE), single-beat 3DE can acquire large volumes at high volume rates in one cardiac cycle, avoiding stitching artifacts or long breath-holds. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy and test-retest reproducibility of single-beat 3DE for quantifying right ventricular (RV) volumes in adult populations of acquired RV pressure or volume overload, namely, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and carcinoid heart disease, respectively. Three-dimensional and 2D echocardiographic indices were also compared for identifying RV dysfunction in PH. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was performed in 100 individuals who underwent 2D echocardiography, 3DE, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: 49 patients with PH, 20 with carcinoid heart disease, 11 with metastatic carcinoid tumors without cardiac involvement, and 20 healthy volunteers. Two operators performed test-retest acquisition and postprocessing for inter- and intraobserver reproducibility in 20 subjects. Results:: RV single-beat 3DE was attainable in 96% of cases, with mean volume rates of 32 to 45 volumes/sec. Bland-Altman analysis of all subjects (presented as mean bias ± 95% limits of agreement) revealed good agreement for end-diastolic volume (-2.3 ± 27.4 mL) and end-systolic volume (5.2 ± 19.0 mL) measured by 3DE and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, with a tendency to underestimate stroke volume (-7.5 ± 23.6 mL) and ejection fraction (-4.6 ± 13.8%) by 3DE. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a greater bias for volumetric underestimation, particularly in healthy volunteers (end-diastolic volume, -11.9 ± 18.0 mL; stroke volume, -11.2 ± 20.2 mL). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that 3DE-derived ejection fraction was significantly superior to 2D echocardiographic parameters for identifying RV dysfunction in PH (sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 88%; area under the curve, 0.95; P = .031). There was significant interobserver test-retest bias for RV volume underestimation (end-diastolic volume, -12.5 ± 28.1 mL; stroke volume, -10.6 ± 23.2 mL). Conclusions: Single-beat 3DE is feasible and clinically applicable for volumetric quantification in acquired RV pressure or volume overload. It has improved limits of agreement compared with previous disk summation 3D echocardiographic studies and has incremental value over standard 2D echocardiographic measures for identifying RV dysfunction. Despite the ability to obtain and postprocess a full-volume 3D echocardiographic RV data set, the quality of the raw data did influence the accuracy of the data obtained. The technique performs better with dilated rather than nondilated RV cavities, with a learning curve that might affect the test-retest reproducibility for serial RV studies.

Heart rate and RV FAC increased significantly in TOF patients (75 ± 10 vs 123 ± 17 beats per minute, p &lt; 0.001; 44 ± 7 vs 51 ± 10%, p = 0.025), and similarly in control subjects (70 ± 11 vs 127 ± 12 beats per minute, p &lt; 0.001; 49 ± 7 vs 61 ± 9%, p = 0.003), when rest was compared to Level 2. PR fraction decreased significantly but only modestly, from rest to Level 2 in TOF patients (37 ± 15 to 31 ± 15%, p = 0.002). Pulmonary artery net forward flow was maintained and did not significantly increase from rest to Level 2 in TOF patients (70 ± 19 vs 69 ± 12 mL/beat, p = 0.854) or controls (93 ± 9 vs 95 ± 21 mL/beat, p = 0.648).Conclusions During exercise in repaired TOF subjects with dilated RV and free PR, increased total RV output per minute was facilitated by an increase in heart rate, an increase in RV FAC and a decrease in PR fraction. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We have proposed that myocardial crypts are part of this phenotype and independently associated with the presence of sarcomere gene mutations. We tested this hypothesis in genetic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pre-LVH (genotype positive, LVH negative [G+LVH-]). Methods and Results: A multicenter case-control study investigated crypts and 22 other cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters in subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to determine their strength of association with sarcomere gene mutation carriage. The G+LVH- sample (n=73) was 29±13 years old and 51% were men. Crypts were related to the presence of sarcomere mutations (for ≥1 crypt, β=2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-4.4; P=0.014 and for ≥2 crypts, β=3.0; 95% CI, 0.8-7.9; P=0.004). In combination with 3 other parameters: anterior mitral valve leaflet elongation (β=2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-3.1; P<0.001), abnormal LV apical trabeculae (β=1.6; 95% CI, 0.8-2.5; P<0.001), and smaller LV end-systolic volumes (β=1.4; 95% CI, 0.5-2.3; P=0.001), multiple crypts indicated the presence of sarcomere gene mutations with 80% accuracy and an area under the curve of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.8-0.9). In this G+LVH- population, cardiac myosin-binding protein C mutation carriers had twice the prevalence of crypts when compared with the other combined mutations (47 versus 23%; odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.9; P=0.045). Conclusions: The subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance in a multicenter environment and consisting of crypts (particularly multiple), anterior mitral valve leaflet elongation, abnormal trabeculae, and smaller LV systolic cavity is indicative of the presence of sarcomere gene mutations and highlights the need for further study. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.","Cardiomyopathy hypertrophic; Genetics; Magnetic resonance imaging","cardiac myosin binding protein c; myosin binding protein C; unclassified drug; muscle protein; adult; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; case control study; controlled study; female; gene mutation; genetic association; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; major clinical study; male; mitral valve; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; phenotype; prediction; predictive value; prevalence; priority journal; sarcomere; subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; adolescent; asymptomatic disease; chi square distribution; clinical trial; genetic predisposition; genetic screening; genetics; heart ventricle; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; mutation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleotide sequence; pathology; procedures; risk; statistical model; United Kingdom; United States; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Asymptomatic Diseases; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Case-Control Studies; Chi-Square Distribution; DNA Mutational Analysis; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Testing; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Logistic Models; London; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mitral Valve; Muscle Proteins; Mutation; Odds Ratio; Phenotype; Predictive Value of Tests; Sarcomeres; United States; Young Adult","Moon, J.C.; Department of Cardiovascular Science, 16-18 Westmoreland St, United Kingdom; email: j.moon@ucl.ac.uk",,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",19419651,,,"25228707","English","Circ.

The arctangent model also required calibration with pulse wave velocity. Carotid tonometry CASP was used as the reference standard.Purpose: Central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) is a more accurate measure of load and cardiovascular risk than brachial pressure. Unfortunately, CASP is difficult to measure using current methods. In this study we report three methods of determining CASP by combining MRderived aortic area curves with different models of the pressure-area relationship.Results: Brachial systolic pressure correlated only moderately with carotid CASP r2=0.46 (P=0.01). However, arctangent, exponential, and linear CASP correlated strongly with carotid CASP, r2=0.90, r2=0.86, r2=0.85, respectively (P&lt;0.0001). There was excellent agreement between carotid CASP and both arctangent (bias 1.5; SD 3.3) and exponential CASP (bias 0.6; SD 3.6). There was a slight underestimation using the linear model (bias -2.3; SD 3.8) and poor agreement and overestimation using brachial systolic pressure (bias 12.9; SD 8.0).Conclusion: We have shown that CASP can be derived from MR data: arctangent and exponential methods being superior to the linear method.

We hypothesized that septal curvature could be used to estimate right ventricular afterload and track acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics. Methods and Results-Fifty patients with a median age of 6.7 years (range, 0.45-16.5 years) underwent combined cardiac catheterization and cardiovascular magnetic resonance. The majority had idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (n=30); the remaining patients had pulmonary hypertension associated with repaired congenital heart disease (n=17) or lung disease (n=3). Mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were acquired at baseline and during vasodilation. Septal curvature was measured using real-time cardiovascular magnetic resonance. There was a strong correlation between mean pulmonary artery pressure and SCmin at baseline and during vasodilator testing (r=-0.81 and -0.85, respectively; P&lt;0.01). A strong linear relationship also existed between pulmonary vascular resistance and minimum septal curvature indexed to cardiac output both at baseline and during vasodilator testing (r=-0.88 and -0.87, respectively; P&lt;0.01). Change in septal curvature metrics moderately correlated with absolute change in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, respectively (r=0.58 and -0.74; P&lt;0.01). Septal curvature metrics were able to identify vasoresponders with a sensitivity of 83% (95% confdence interval, 0.36-0.99) and a specifcity of 91% (95% confdence interval, 0.77-0.97), using the Sitbon criteria. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension subgroup analysis revealed 3 responders with ΔSCmin values of 0.523, 0.551, and 0.568. If the middle value of 0.551 is taken as a cutoff, the approximate sensitivity would be 67% and the specifcity would be 93%. Conclusions-Septal curvature metrics are able to estimate right ventricular afterload and track acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics during vasodilator testing.

Subtle abnormalities of the myocardium may be present in mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy (G+LVH-) but are difficult to quantify. Fractal analysis has been used to define trabeculae in left ventricular noncompaction and to identify normal racial variations. We hypothesized that trabeculae measured by fractal analysis of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images are abnormal in G+LVH-patients, providing a preclinical marker of disease in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results-Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed on 40 G+LVH-patients (33±15 years, 38% men), 67 patients with a clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (53±15 years, 76% men; 31 with a pathogenic mutation [G+LVH+]), and 69 matched healthy volunteers (44±15 years, 57% men). Trabeculae were quantified by fractal analysis of cine slices to calculate the fractal dimension, a unitless index of endocardial complexity calculated from endocardial contours after segmentation. In G+LVH-patients, apical left ventricular trabeculation was increased compared with controls (maximal apical fractal dimension, 1.249±0.07 versus 1.199±0.05; P=0.001). In G+LVH+ and G-LVH+ cohorts, maximal apical fractal dimension was greater than in controls (P>0.0001) irrespective of gene status (G+LVH+: 1.370±0.08; G-LVH+: 1.380±0.09). Compared with controls, G+LVH-patients also had a higher frequency of clefts (28% versus 8%; P=0.02), longer anterior mitral valve leaflets (23.5±3.0 versus 19.7±3.1 mm; P>0.0001), greater septal systolic wall thickness (12.6±3.2 versus 11.2±2.1 mm; P=0.03), higher ejection fraction (71±4% versus 69±4%; P=0.03), and smaller end-systolic volumes (38±9 versus 43±12 mL; P=0.03).

Methods The sequence was based on a golden-angle spiral acquisition. Reconstruction of real-time images allowed creation of an image-based navigator. The expiratory spiral interleaves were then retrospectively cardiac-gated using data binning. TPM data were acquired in 20 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with pulmonary hypertension. Longitudinal and radial myocardial velocities were calculated in the left ventricle and right ventricle. Results The image-based navigator was shown to correlate well with simultaneously acquired airflow data in 10 volunteers(r=0.93±0.04). The TPM navigated images had a significantly higher subjective image quality and edge sharpness (P<0.0001) than averaged spiral TPM. No significant differences in myocardial velocities were seen between conventional Cartesian TPM with navigator respiratory-gating and the proposed self-navigated TPM technique, in 10 volunteers. Significant differences in the velocities were seen between the volunteers and patients in the left ventricle at systole and end diastole and in the right ventricle at end diastole.

Effects on lipid status or clotting do not fully explain these benefits. Exaggerated cardiovascular responses to mental stress are detrimental to cardiovascular health. We hypothesized that habitual alcohol consumption might reduce these responses, with potential benefits. Advanced magnetic resonance techniques were used to accurately measure cardiovascular responses to an acute mental stressor (Montreal Imaging Stress Task) in 88 healthy adults (∼1:1 male:female). Salivary cortisol and task performance measures were used to assess endocrine and cognitive responses. Habitual alcohol consumption and confounding factors were assessed by questionnaire. Alcohol consumption was inversely related to responses of heart rate (HR) (r=-0.31, p=0.01), cardiac output (CO) (r=-0.32, p=0.01), vascular resistance (r=0.25, p=0.04) and mean blood pressure (r=-0.31, p=0.01) provoked by stress, but not to stroke volume (SV), or arterial compliance changes. However, high alcohol consumers had greater cortisol stress responses, compared to moderate consumers (3.5 versus 0.7nmol/L, p=0.04). Cognitive measures did not differ. Findings were not explained by variations in age, sex, social class, ethnicity, physical activity, adrenocortical activity, adiposity, smoking, menstrual phase and chronic stress. Habitual alcohol consumption is associated with reduced cardiac responsiveness during mental stress, which has been linked to lower risk of hypertension and vascular disease. Consistent with established evidence, our findings suggest a mechanism by which moderate alcohol consumption might reduce cardiovascular disease, but not high consumption, where effects such as greater cortisol stress responses may negate any benefits. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.","Alcohol; Cardioprotective; Cardiovascular risk; Drinking; Mental stress; Stress responsiveness","alcohol; hydrocortisone; adult; alcohol consumption; artery compliance; article; cardiovascular response; cardiovascular stress; chronic stress; controlled study; drinking behavior; female; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; human; human experiment; male; mean arterial pressure; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; saliva level; stress; task performance; vascular resistance; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Cardiac Output; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular System; Cognition; Ethanol; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Saliva; Stress, Psychological","Jones, A.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, 30 Guilford Street, London WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom; email: alex.jones@ucl.ac.uk",,,10253890,,STREF,"23425242","English","Stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879069759

Current methods for quantification of LV trabeculae have limitations. The aim of this study is to describe a novel technique for quantifying LV trabeculation using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and fractal geometry. Observing that trabeculae appear complex and irregular, we hypothesize that measuring the fractal dimension (FD) of the endocardial border provides a quantitative parameter that can be used to distinguish normal from abnormal trabecular patterns. Methods. Fractal analysis is a method of quantifying complex geometric patterns in biological structures. The resulting FD is a unitless measure index of how completely the object fills space. FD increases with increased structural complexity. LV FD was measured using a box-counting method on CMR short-axis cine stacks. Three groups were studied: LVNC (defined by Jenni criteria), n=30(age 41±13; men, 16); healthy whites, n=75(age, 46±16; men, 36); healthy blacks, n=30(age, 40±11; men, 15). Results: In healthy volunteers FD varied in a characteristic pattern from base to apex along the LV. This pattern was altered in LVNC where apical FD were abnormally elevated. In healthy volunteers, blacks had higher FD than whites in the apical third of the LV (maximal apical FD: 1.253±0.005 vs. 1.235±0.004, p<0.01) (mean±s.e.m.). Comparing LVNC with healthy volunteers, maximal apical FD was higher in LVNC (1.392±0.010, p<0.00001). The fractal method was more accurate and reproducible (ICC, 0.97 and 0.96 for intra and inter-observer readings) than two other CMR criteria for LVNC (Petersen and Jacquier). Conclusions: FD is higher in LVNC patients compared to healthy volunteers and is higher in healthy blacks than in whites. Fractal analysis provides a quantitative measure of trabeculation and has high reproducibility and accuracy for LVNC diagnosis when compared to current CMR criteria. © 2013 Captur et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Cardiomyopathy; Heart failure; Trabeculation","adult; aged; article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Caucasian; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; endocardium; female; fractal analysis; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle trabeculae; human; image analysis; intermethod comparison; male; Negro; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; predictive value; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; ventricular noncompaction; Adolescent; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chi-Square Distribution; Echocardiography; European Continental Ancestry Group; Fractals; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Isolated Noncompaction of the Ventricular Myocardium; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left","Moon, J.C.; Division of Cardiovascular Imaging, 16-18 Westmoreland Street, London, W1G 8PH, United Kingdom; email: james.moon@uclh.nhs.uk",,,10976647,,JCMRF,"23663522","English","J.

Cardiac MRI is a useful, noninvasive method for determining prognosis in adults. The present study is the first to assess its prognostic value in children. Methods and Results: A total of 100 children with pulmonary hypertension (median, 10.4 years; range, 0.5-17.6 years) were evaluated (idiopathic, n=60; repaired congenital heart disease, n=22; miscellaneous, n=18). In all patients, ventricular volumes and great vessel flow were measured. Volumetric data were obtained using retrospectively gated cine imaging (n=37) or real-time imaging (n=63), depending on the patient's ability to hold his or her breath. During a median follow-up of 1.9 years, 11 patients died and 3 received lung transplantation. Of the cardiac MR parameters measured, right ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular stroke volume index were most strongly predictive of survival on univariate analysis (2.6- and 2.5-fold increase in mortality for every 1-SD decrease, respectively; P<0.05). These results were reflected in good separation of tertile-based Kaplan-Meier survival curves for these variables. Conclusions: Cardiac MR measures correlate with clinical status and prognosis in children with pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac MR is feasible and may be useful in clinical decision making in pediatric pulmonary hypertension. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.","Echocardiography; Hypertension; MRI; Pediatric; Prognosis; Pulmonary","adolescent; article; blood flow; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular mortality; child; congenital heart disease; female; follow up; great blood vessel; heart ejection fraction; heart left ventricle; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle volume; human; image analysis; image processing; lung transplantation; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; overall survival; preschool child; priority journal; prognosis; pulmonary hypertension; school child; survival prediction; age; analysis of variance; breath holding; cardiac gated imaging; disease course; echocardiography; heart left ventricle function; heart right ventricle function; hemodynamics; hypertension; infant; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; pediatric; predictive value; proportional hazards model; pulmonary; pulmonary hypertension; retrospective study; risk factor; severity of illness index; statistical model; time; United Kingdom; echocardiography; hypertension; MRI; pediatric; prognosis; pulmonary; Adolescent; Age Factors; Analysis of Variance; Breath Holding; Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Progression; Female; Great Britain; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Infant; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Linear Models; Lung Transplantation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Function, Right","Muthurangu, V.; National Pulmonary Hypertension Service, Main Nurses Home, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London WC1N 3JH, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,,19419651,,,"23572488","English","Circ.

It is poorly detected by conventional angiography. Intravascular ultrasound is invasive and costly. This study shows that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) of the coronary vessel wall can detect and grade coronary allograft vasculopathy. Methods and Results-Twenty-four children (10 male; age range, 9-17 years) underwent coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and MRI. Maximal intimal thickness and mean intimal index were recorded. MRI included coronary magnetic resonance angiogram and LGE vessel wall imaging with 1.5 T (n=12) and 3.0 T (n=12). Ten healthy control subjects also underwent LGE MRI. Mean time posttransplantation was 5.5 years (range, 0.25-14 years). Seven patients had Stanford grade IV coronary allograft vasculopathy on intravascular ultrasound, 3 of whom had angiographic disease. Maximal intimal thickness and mean intimal index were 0.73±0.50 mm and 20.9±10.6%, respectively. On MRI, mean diameter of enhancement of vessel wall was 6.57±4.91 mm, and mean enhancement index (indexed to vessel lumen size) was 1.10±1.72. The control group showed little or no LGE. Correlation of LGE with maximal intimal thickness using the Pearson coefficient was 0.80 (P<0.001) and with mean intimal index was 0.92 (P<0.001). An MRI diameter >7.5 mm gave 86% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Conclusions-LGE scores correlate well with traditional intravascular ultrasound measures. These promising early results encourage larger-scale clinical studies to investigate whether LGE MRI will allow closer follow-up and better prevention of coronary allograft vasculopathy in children. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.","Coronary artery disease; Heart transplantation; Intravascular ultrasound; MRI; Pediatrics","gadobutrol; gadolinium; contrast medium; diagnostic agent; gadolinium; organometallic compound; adolescent; angiocardiography; article; blood vessel wall; cardiac allograft vasculopathy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; coronary blood vessel; female; human; intravascular ultrasound; male; priority journal; school child; sensitivity and specificity; allotransplantation; comparative study; coronary artery disease; follow up; graft rejection; heart transplantation; infant; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; preschool child; reproducibility; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Contrast Media; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gadolinium; Graft Rejection; Heart Transplantation; Humans; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Organometallic Compounds; Reproducibility of Results; Transplantation, Homologous","Hussain, T.; King's College London, Westminster Bridge Rd, London SE17EH, United Kingdom; email: Tarique@doctors.org.uk",,,19419651,,,"23223637","English","Circ.

Materials and Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers underwent aortic flow examination during exercise using a real-time spiral PCMR sequence. Acquired data were reconstructed in online fashion using an iterative sensitivity encoding (SENSE) algorithm implemented on an external computer equipped with a GPU card. Importantly, data were sent back to the scanner console for viewing. A multithreaded CPU implementation of the real-time PCMR reconstruction was used as a reference point for the online GPU reconstruction assessment and validation. A semiautomated segmentation and registration algorithm was applied for flow data analysis. Results: There was good agreement between the GPU and CPU reconstruction (-0.4 ± 0.8 mL). There was a significant speed-up compared to the CPU reconstruction (15×). This translated into the flow data being available on the scanner console ≈9 seconds after acquisition finished. This compares to an estimated time using the CPU implementation of 83 minutes. Conclusion: Our heterogeneous image reconstruction system provides a base for translation of complex MRI algorithms into clinical workflow.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that delaying PVR in patients with ToF and severe PR would lead to short-term progressive deterioration in right ventricular/left ventricular (RV/LV) dimensions or function. We compared PVR-treated patients with matched untreated patients who were eligible for PVR based on hemodynamic status. Methods: A current cohort of 87 patients with ToF and free PR serial cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) assessments at a median interval of 1.8 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.4-2.1) were identified. During this interval, 51 patients had surgical PVR and 36 patients were managed conservatively. Twenty-five patients from each group were matched for comparison using propensity score matching (PSM). RV and LV measurements were assessed by CMR at rest at follow-up. Results: There was no significant deterioration in RV or LV measurements in the matched untreated patients over a median of 1.8 years. ""Normalization"" of right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and end systolic volume (ESV) after PVR occurred in the majority of patients during the study period, and no absolute ceiling beyond which the right ventricle did not normalize could be discerned. In a group of treated patients who were not matchable because of severe baseline characteristics, there was a significant improvement in resting cardiac output (CO) after PVR (from 2.9 to 3.3 L/min/m2; p = 0.001). Conclusions: Our data indicate that patients with intermediate RV dilatation and severe PR are at low risk for significant progression in the short term, which can guide the interval for CMR imaging and advise the timing for future PVR. © 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",,"adolescent; adult; article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; comparative study; conservative treatment; disease severity; Fallot tetralogy; female; follow up; heart hemodynamics; heart output; heart right ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart right ventricle endsystolic volume; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; pulmonary valve insufficiency; pulmonary valve replacement; therapy delay; Adolescent; Child; Disease Progression; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Male; Pulmonary Valve; Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency; Severity of Illness Index; Tetralogy of Fallot; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Dysfunction; Young Adult","Quail, M.A.; Old Nurses Home, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, United Kingdom; email: m.quail@ucl.ac.uk",,,00034975,,ATHSA,"22959579","English","Ann.

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at rest and during supine exercise stress pre-and within 1-month post-PPVI, using a radial k-t SENSE real-time sequence. In patients with PS (n 9), there was no reserve in right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) in response to exercise prior to PPVI (48.2 ± 12.1 at rest vs. 48.4 ± 14.8 during exercise, P 0.87). Post-PPVI, reserve in RVEF in response to exercise was re-established (53.4 ± 15.0 at rest vs. 59.6 ± 17.3 during exercise, P 0.003) with improvement in left ventricular stroke volume (LVSV) (45.4 ± 6.2 mL/m2 at rest vs. 52.8 ± 8.8 mL/m2 during exercise, P 0.001). In patients with PR prior to PPVI (n 8), LVSV during exercise increased (43.0 ± 8.5 vs. 54.3 ± 6.6 mL/m2, P &lt; 0.001) due to reduction in PR fraction during exercise (29.2 ± 5.2 vs. 13.6 ± 6.1, P &lt; 0.001). After PPVI, LVSV increased from rest to exercise (48.4 ± 8.8 vs. 57.2 ± 8.1 mL/m2, P &lt; 0.001) due to improved RVEF (45.5 ± 8.3 vs. 50.4 ± 6.9, P 0.001). There was a significantly higher increase in LVSV at exercise from pre-to post-PPVI in PS patients than in PR patients (ΔLVSV 8.2 ± 4.1 vs. Δ2.9 ± 4.1 mL/m2, P 0.01). The reduction in the RV outflow tract gradient correlated significantly with the improvement in LVSV during exercise (r-0.73, P &lt; 0.001). ConclusionPercutaneous pulmonary valve implantation in patients with PS leads to restoration of reserve in RVEF during exercise stress. In patients with PR, SV augmentation improves only mildly post-PPVI. Improvement in SV augmentation during exercise stress after PPVI is dependent mainly on afterload reduction. © 2012 The European Society of Cardiology All rights reserved.","Congenital heart disease; Exercise physiology; Exercise stress magnetic resonance imaging; Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation; Right ventricular outflow tract dysfunction","adolescent; adult; article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; clinical article; correlation analysis; exercise; female; heart hemodynamics; heart right ventricle; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart stroke volume; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; pulmonary valve insufficiency; pulmonary valve replacement; pulmonary valve stenosis; school child; supine position; Adolescent; Adult; Cardiac Catheterization; Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques; Child; Exercise; Exercise Test; Female; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Valve; Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency; Pulmonary Valve Stenosis; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Right; Young Adult","Lurz, P.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, , London, United Kingdom; email: philipp.lurz@gmx.de",,,0195668X,,EHJOD,"22798559","English","Eur.

Flow-velocity and area can both be derived from high-resolution phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (PC-CMR). In this study, very high temporal resolution PC-CMR data is processed using an integrated and semi-automatic technique to derive wave intensity. Methods: Wave intensity was derived in terms of area and velocity changes. These data were directly derived from PC-CMR using a breath-hold spiral sequence accelerated with sensitivity encoding (SENSE). Image processing was integrated in a plug-in for the DICOM viewer OsiriX, including calculations of wave speed and wave intensity. Ascending and descending aortic data from 15 healthy volunteers (30 ± 6 years) data were used to test the method for feasibility, and intra- and inter-observer variability. Ascending aortic data were also compared with results from 15 patients with coronary heart disease (61 ± 13 years) to assess the clinical usefulness of the method. Results: Rapid image acquisition (11 s breath-hold) and image processing was feasible in all volunteers. Wave speed was physiological (5.8 ± 1.3 m/s ascending aorta, 5.0 ± 0.7 m/s descending aorta) and the wave intensity pattern was consistent with traditionally formulated wave intensity. Wave speed, peak forward compression wave in early systole and peak forward expansion wave in late systole at both locations exhibited overall good intra- and inter-observer variability. Patients with coronary heart disease had higher wave speed (p <0.0001), and lower forward compression wave (p <0.0001) and forward expansion wave (p <0.0005) peaks. This difference is likely related to the older age of the patients' cohort, indicating stiffer aortas, as well as compromised ventricular function due to their underlying condition. Conclusion: A non-invasive, semi-automated and reproducible method for performing wave intensity analysis is presented. Its application is facilitated by the use of a very high temporal resolution spiral sequence. A formulation of wave intensity based on area change has also been proposed, involving no assumptions about the cross-sectional shape of the vessel. © 2012 Biglino et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Hemodynamics; Spiral sequence; Wave intensity analysis","adult; aged; aorta flow; article; ascending aorta; blood flow velocity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular system examination; clinical article; cohort analysis; computer analysis; computer program; controlled study; coronary artery disease; descending aorta; feasibility study; female; groups by age; heart ventricle function; human; image analysis; image processing; male; non invasive procedure; optical resolution; priority journal; pulse wave; pulse wave intensity analysis; systole; ultrahigh temporal resolution phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Adult; Aged; Aorta; Automation, Laboratory; Blood Flow Velocity; Breath Holding; Case-Control Studies; Coronary Artery Disease; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulse Wave Analysis; Regional Blood Flow; Reproducibility of Results; Vascular Stiffness; Young Adult","Muthurangu, V.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, , London, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ucl.ac.uk",,,10976647,,JCMRF,"22876747","English","J.

Resilience to stress may differ according to adiposity. Early studies that addressed this are difficult to interpret due to conflicting findings and limited methods. Recent advances in assessment of cardiovascular stress responses and of fat distribution allow accurate assessment of associations between adiposity and stress responsiveness. We measured responses to the Montreal Imaging Stress Task in healthy men (N = 43) and women (N = 45) with a wide range of BMIs. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) measures were used with novel magnetic resonance measures of stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR) and arterial compliance to assess cardiovascular responses. Salivary cortisol and the number and speed of answers to mathematics problems in the task were used to assess neuroendocrine and cognitive responses, respectively. Visceral and subcutaneous fat was measured using T2*-IDEAL. Greater BMI was associated with generalised blunting of cardiovascular (HR:β = -0.50 bpm.unit-1, P = 0.009; SV:β = -0.33 mL.unit-1, P = 0.01; CO:β = -61 mL.min-1.unit-1, P = 0.002; systolic BP:β = -0.41 mmHg.unit-1, P = 0.01; TPR:β = 0.11 WU.unit-1, P = 0.02), cognitive (correct answers: r = -0.28, P = 0.01; time to answer: r = 0.26, P = 0.02) and endocrine responses (cortisol: r = -0.25, P = 0.04) to stress. These associations were largely determined by visceral adiposity except for those related to cognitive performance, which were determined by both visceral and subcutaneous adiposity. Our findings suggest that adiposity is associated with centrally reduced stress responsiveness. Although this may mitigate some long-term health risks of stress responsiveness, reduced performance under stress may be a more immediate negative consequence. © 2012 Jones et al.",,"hydrocortisone; adult; artery compliance; article; blood pressure measurement; body mass; cardiovascular response; cognition; controlled study; disease association; female; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hormone release; human; human tissue; intraabdominal fat; major clinical study; male; mathematical analysis; mental stress; neuroendocrine system; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; subcutaneous fat; vascular resistance; Adiposity; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Pressure; Cardiac Output; Cardiovascular System; Cognition; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","Jones, A.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, , London, United Kingdom; email: alex.jones@ucl.ac.uk",,,19326203,,,"22745709","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862651044

Understanding their influence on patient outcomes has been hampered by uncertainty about the optimal method of quantifying SPC flow. Objective: To quantify SPC flow by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) prior to total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) in order to identify preoperative risk factors and determine influence on postoperative outcomes. Design: Single centre prospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary referral centre. Patients: 65 patients with single ventricle physiology undergoing CMR for preoperative assessment of TCPC completion underwent quantification of SPC flow. Clinical outcomes of 41 patients in whom TCPC was completed were obtained. Main outcome measures: Early post-TCPC clinical outcomes associated with SPC flow were assessed, including postoperative chest drainage volume, postoperative chest drainage duration and length of intensive care and hospital stays. Additionally preoperative covariates associated with SPC flow were assessed including age at BCPC and CMR, SpO 2 at BCPC and CMR, ventricle type, pulmonary artery (PA) crosssectional area and PA pulsatility. Different methods of CMR SPC flow quantification were compared. Results: Higher SPC flow was associated with increased postoperative chest drain volume (r=0.51, p=0.001), chest drain duration (r=0.43, p=0.005), and intensive care unit (r=0.32, p=0.04) and log-transformed hospital stays (r=0.31, p=0.048). The effect of SPC flow on outcome was independent of fenestration, ventricle type and function. Preoperative covariates associated with SPC flow included age at BCPC (β=-0.34, p=0.008), SpO 2 at time of CMR (β=0.34, p=0.004) and branch PA cross-sectional area (β=-0.26, p=0.036), model R 2=0.34. Moreover, patients with pulsatile pulmonary blood flow had lower SPC flow than those without (0.8 vs 1.3 l/min/m 2 p=0.012). SPC flow calculated by the difference between pulmonary venous return and pulmonary artery flow (l/min/m 2) showed greatest association with preoperative covariates and strongest correlation with postoperative outcomes compared with other methods of quantification. Conclusions: CMR can provide an effective measurement of SPC flow prior to TCPC.

Nevertheless, interventional cardiac catheterization is a growth area in congenital heart disease. Furthermore, diagnostic cardiac catheterization is still necessary when intra-cardiac or intra-vascular pressure measurements are necessary. Currently, X-ray fluoroscopy is the imaging modality of choice for guiding cardiac catheterization with some interventions also utilizing echocardiography. However, there are problems with this approach and the use of MR during catheterization may be able to solve them. In this chapter the role of MR in the catheterization laboratory, both for guidance and cardiac assessment, will be reviewed.

However, there are little data regarding right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) contractile dysfunction in response to chronic PR and on both RV and LV volumes and function. Methods: We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with PR who were referred for magnetic resonance imaging quantification of ""free PR"" detected on echocardiography between 2003 and 2008. Patients had ToF and a transannular patch procedure (n = 30, 25.1 ± 1.2 years) or PR resulting from valvar pulmonary stenosis treated with surgical or percutaneous valvotomy (n = 30, 26.6 ± 1.8 years). Results: The ToF and the PS groups were well matched for age at scan, age at repair surgery in ToF or initial valvotomy in PS, duration of exposure to PR, body surface area, heart rate, PR fraction, net forward pulmonary artery flow, and main and branch pulmonary artery dimensions. Severe PR fractions were identified in both groups (ToF: 40% ± 1% vs PS: 37% ± 2%, P = .2). Indexed RV and LV end-diastolic volumes were similar for both ToF and PS groups (RV end-diastolic volume index: 137 ± 6 mL/m 2 vs 128 ± 5 mL/m 2, P = .2, and LV end-diastolic volume index: 72 ± 2 mL/m 2 vs 67 ± 2 mL/m 2, P = .1, respectively). RV mass was also similar between groups (95 ± 5 g vs 81 ± 6 g, respectively, P = .08). However, indexed RV and LV end-systolic volumes were consistently higher in ToF when compared with PS (RV end-systolic volume index: 70 ± 5 mL/m 2 vs 54 ± 3 mL/m 2, P &lt; .01, and LV end-systolic volume index: 29 ± 1 mL/m 2 vs 22 ± 1 mL/m 2, P &lt; .01, respectively). These changes were reflected in lower biventricular systolic function in patients with ToF when compared with PS (RV ejection fraction: 52% ± 1.5% vs 59% ± 1%, P &lt; .001, and LV ejection fraction: 61% ± 1% vs 67 ± 1%, P &lt; .001, respectively). Although RV transannular plane systolic excursion was not significantly different between the groups (P = .86), the RV outflow tract was considered contractile in only 50% of patients with ToF compared with 93% of patients with PS (P = .0004). RV volumes and function were similar when only patients with contractile RV outflow tracts were compared. Conclusions: RV outflow tract patch dysfunction in repaired ToF is responsible for higher end-systolic volumes and thus lower global measures of ventricular systolic function. These findings were not evident in cases of PS treated with valvotomy with comparable amount of PR. These observations highlight the importance of the initial repair surgery in ToF for late outcomes.

Phase-contrast magnetic resonance underestimates peak velocities. Hence, clinically Doppler ultrasound is used as the reference standard for assessing stenoses. It is possible to accurately measure peak velocity in MR using Fourier velocity encoding (FVE). In this study, a fast, high-resolution slice-selective FVE sequence was developed with the use of spiral trajectories, parallel imaging, and partial Fourier in the velocity dimension and a novel velocity-unwrap technique. The resulting sequence was acquired within a short breath-hold (more than 15 heartbeats) making this FVE technique clinically achievable. Peak velocities were compared from Doppler ultrasound, phase-contrast magnetic resonance, and FVE. Experiments were carried out in vitro and in vivo in 25 patients with congenital heart disease with stenoses. It was shown that in vitro and in vivo phase-contrast magnetic resonance tended to underestimate peak velocity when compared with Doppler ultrasound, whereas FVE agreed well with Doppler ultrasound.

Survival was retrospectively analysed among the cohort of locally followed survivors of Norwood Stage I procedure, who underwent magnetic resonance imaging under general anaesthesia from 2003 to 2008. This included 32 patients: 17 with Sano conduit and 15 with arterio-pulmonary shunt. The median (inter-quartile range) age and weight at scan were 3.1 (2.6-4.6) months and 5.0 (4.5-5.3) kilograms, respectively. Using morphologic definitions, the median coarctation index was 0.71 (0.57-0.83). The degree of proximal right and left pulmonary artery narrowing was 25% (14-44%) and 25% (11-50%), respectively. The median right ventricular ejection fraction was 54% (48-59%). The ejection fraction was not related to the coarctation index or to pulmonary artery narrowing. Patients were followed up for a median of 19.2 (10.8-46.0) months, during which 13 (41%) had an intervention in addition to routine Norwood Stage II surgery and seven died. Risk of death was related to reduced right ventricular ejection fraction, with a hazard ratio of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.85-0.98, p = 0.02), and the cumulative number of focal stenoses of neo-aortic arch and pulmonary arteries (hazard ratio 2.71, 95% confidence interval 1.14-6.44, p = 0.02). Conclusions: In addition to comprehensive three-dimensional morphologic imaging, inter-stage cardiac magnetic resonance imaging provides a ventricular functional index that may predict outcome in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Measures to preserve right ventricular systolic function and relieve stenoses are paramount within the complex management strategies for these patients. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2011.","cardiac imaging; coarctation; ejection fraction; pulmonary artery; Single ventricle","age; aorta arch; aorta coarctation; aorta stenosis; article; Blalock Taussig shunt; body weight; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; female; general anesthesia; heart output; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart right ventricle function; human; hypoplastic left heart syndrome; major clinical study; male; mortality; Norwood procedure; prediction; pulmonary artery occlusion; retrospective study; right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit; survival; survivor; three dimensional imaging; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Cohort Studies; England; Female; Humans; Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis","Hughes, M.L.; Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, United Kingdom; email: hughem@gosh.nhs.uk",,,10479511,,CYAOB,"21729513","English","Cardiol.

This study shows the role of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in assessing young patients following surgical repair of ALCAPA. Methods. 6 patients, aged 9-21 years, with repaired ALCAPA (2 Tackeuchi method, 4 direct re-implantation) underwent CMR because of clinical suspicion of myocardial ischemia. Imaging used short and long axis cine images (assess ventricular function), late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (detect segmental myocardial fibrosis), adenosine stress perfusion (detect reversible ischaemia) and 3D whole-heart imaging (visualize proximal coronary arteries). Results: The left ventricular (LV) global systolic function was preserved in all patients (mean LV ejection fraction = 62.7% 4.23%). The LV volumes were within the normal ranges, (mean indexed LVEDV = 75.4 3.5 ml/m 2, LVESV = 31.6 9.4 ml/m 2). In 1 patient, hypokinesia of the anterior segments was visualized. Five patients showed sub-endocardial LGE involving the basal, antero-lateral wall and the anterior papillary muscle. Three patients had areas of reversible ischemia. In these 3, 3D whole-heart MRA showed that the proximal course of the left coronary artery was occluded (confirmed with cardiac catheterisation). Conclusions: CMR is a good, non-invasive, radiation-free investigation in the post-surgical evaluation of ALCAPA. In referred patients we show that basal, antero-lateral sub-endocardial myocardial fibrosis is a characteristic finding. Furthermore, stress adenosine CMR perfusion, can identify reversible ischemia in this group, and was indicative of left coronary artery occlusion. © 2011 Secinaro et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adenosine; gadolinium; contrast medium; diagnostic agent; gadoterate meglumine; meglumine; organometallic compound; adolescent; adult; angiocardiography; anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery; article; bland garland white syndrome; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular malformation; cardiovascular surgery; child; clinical article; congenital heart malformation; contrast enhancement; coronary artery anomaly; electrocardiogram; female; heart infarction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle volume; heart muscle ischemia; human; left coronary artery; magnetic resonance angiography; male; non invasive procedure; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; postoperative period; priority journal; pulmonary artery; three dimensional imaging; computer assisted diagnosis; congenital malformation; coronary artery blood flow; coronary blood vessel; coronary vessel malformation; fibrosis; heart catheterization; heart muscle; heart muscle ischemia; heart stroke volume; heart surgery; methodology; myocardial perfusion imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; pathophysiology; predictive value; pulmonary artery; reimplantation; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Child; Contrast Media; Coronary Circulation; Coronary Vessel Anomalies; Coronary Vessels; Female; Fibrosis; Heart Catheterization; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Meglumine; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardial Perfusion Imaging; Myocardium; Organometallic Compounds; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulmonary Artery; Replantation; Retrospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Function, Left; Young Adult","Taylor, A.M.; Cardiorespiratory Unit, , London, United Kingdom; email: a.taylor@ich.ucl.ac.uk",,,10976647,,JCMRF,"21575211","English","J.

Design: A retrospective analysis of ECG-gated CT pulmonary angiograms. Setting: A single national referral centre for the investigation and treatment of children with pulmonary hypertension. Patients: Consecutive CT pulmonary angiograms in children and young adults (mean age 10.3 years, range 0.7-19.1) with pulmonary arterial hypertension assessed between January 2007 and April 2009. Main outcome measures: The fractal dimension (FD) of skeletonised CT pulmonary angiograms was calculated using the box counting method. The FD was compared with pulmonary vascular resistance, the percentage of predicted 6-min walk distance, WHO functional class and survival. Results: Diagnostic plots confirmed that the pulmonary artery angiograms were all fractal. The FD correlated negatively with the pulmonary vascular resistance index (r=-0.55, p=0.01, n=21) and with WHO functional class (p<0.01, n=31) while it correlated positively with the percentage of predicted 6-min walk distance (r=0.43, p=0.04, n=24). A lower FD was associated with poorer survival (HR 5.6; 95% CI 1.2 to 25; p=0.027) for every SD reduction in FD. Conclusion: The FD derived from CT can be used to quantify vascular changes in pulmonary hypertension.

Materials and Methods: The local research ethics committee approved this study, and written consent was obtained from all patients or guardians. Stroke volumes were quantified in 40 patients (mean age ± standard deviation: 21.4 years ± 13.8, age range: 3.0-61.3 years; 22 male patients aged 3.0-38.0 years [mean age, 17.2 years ± 10.5], 18 female patients aged 4.7-61.3 years [mean age, 26.6 years ± 15.9]) with congenital heart disease in the aorta (n = 40), main pulmonary artery (n = 38), right pulmonary artery (n = 22), and left pulmonary artery (n = 24). Stroke volumes were obtained with (a) breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR imaging with SENSE, (b) conventional breath-hold cartesian phase-contrast MR imaging, and (c) reference free-breathing phase-contrast MR imaging. Stroke volumes were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance, Bland-Altman analysis, and correlation coefficients. Results: Imaging time with the breath-hold spiral phase-contrast MR sequence was significantly lower than that with the conventional breath-hold phase-contrast MR sequence (∼5 seconds vs ∼16 seconds, respectively; P < .0001). There was excellent agreement in stroke volumes in all vessels between the reference free-breathing sequence (mean volume, 60.3 mL ± 27.3) and the two breath-hold sequences - spiral SENSE phase-contrast MR imaging (mean volume, 59.5 mL ± 27.1; P < .001) and conventional cartesian phase-contrast MR imaging (mean volume, 59.8 mL ± 27.6; P = .268). The limits of agreement were smaller with the spiral breath-hold sequence than with the conventional breath-hold sequence (-4.4 mL, 2.9 mL vs -10.3 mL, 9.3 mL, respectively); correlation was similar (r = 0.998 vs r = 0.984, respectively). Conclusion: Flow volumes can be accurately and reliably quantified by using a spiral SENSE phase-contrast MR sequence, with high spatiotemporal resolution obtained in a short breath hold. © RSNA, 2011.",,"adolescent; adult; age distribution; article; ascending aorta; blood regurgitation; blood rheology; breath holding; child; clinical article; congenital heart disease; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; heart rate; heart stroke volume; human; image analysis; image quality; image reconstruction; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; optical resolution; preschool child; priority journal; pulmonary artery; sensitivity analysis; sex difference; spiral phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging; validity; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Flow Velocity; Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronary Circulation; Female; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Perfusion Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult","Muthurangu, V.; Centre for Cardiovascular MR, Great Ormond St, London WC1N 3JH, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ich.ucl.ac.uk",,,00338419,,RADLA,"21415248","English","Radiology",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959537780

Background: PPVI has been shown to impact acutely on biventricular function and exercise performance, but the potential for further late functional remodeling remains unknown. Methods: Sixty-five patients with sustained hemodynamic effects of PPVI at 1 year were included. Patients were divided into 2 subgroups based on pre-procedural predominant pulmonary stenosis (PS) (n = 35) or predominant pulmonary regurgitation (PR) (n = 30). Data from magnetic resonance imaging and cardiopulmonary exercise testing were compared at 3 time points: before PPVI, within 1 month (early) and at 12 months (late) after PPVI. Results: There was a significant decrease in right ventricle end-diastolic volume early after PPVI in both subgroups of patients. Right ventricle ejection fraction improved early only in the PS group (51 ± 11% vs. 58 ± 11% and 51 ± 12% vs. 50 ± 11%, p < 0.001 for PS, p = 0.13 for PR). Late after intervention, there were no further changes in magnetic resonance parameters in either group (right ventricle ejection fraction, 58 ± 11% in the PS group and 52 ± 11% in the PR group, p = 1.00 and p = 0.13, respectively). In the PS group at cardiopulmonary exercise testing, there was a significant improvement in peak oxygen uptake early (24 ± 8 ml/kg/min vs. 27 ± 9 ml/kg/min, p = 0.008), with no further significant change late (27 ± 9 ml/kg/min, p = 1.00). In the PR group, no significant changes in peak oxygen uptake from early to late could be demonstrated (25 ± 8 ml/kg/min vs. 25 ± 8 ml/kg/min vs. 26 ± 9 ml/kg/min, p = 0.48). Conclusions: In patients with a sustained hemodynamic result 1 year after PPVI, a prolonged phase of maintained cardiac function is observed. However, there is no evidence for further positive functional remodeling beyond the acute effects of PPVI. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.","cardiopulmonary exercise testing; congenital heart disease; magnetic resonance imaging; percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation; right ventricular outflow tract dysfunction","article; cardiopulmonary exercise test; functional assessment; heart hemodynamics; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart right ventricle outflow tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen transport; priority journal; pulmonary valve insufficiency; pulmonary valve replacement; pulmonary valve stenosis; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Echocardiography; Exercise Test; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Hemodynamics; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency; Ventricular Function; Young Adult","Lurz, P.; Department of Internal Medicine/Cardiology and Grown Up Congenital Heart Disease, Struempellstr. 39, 04289 Leipzig, Germany; email: Philipp.Lurz@gmx.de",,,07351097,,JACCD,"21292132","English","J.

Background LGE by cardiac magnetic resonance is the gold-standard technique for assessing myocardial scar. No consensus exists on the best method for its quantification, and research in this area is scant. Techniques include manual quantification, thresholding by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 SDs above remote myocardium, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) technique. To date, LGE has been linked to outcome in 3 conditions: AMI, CMI, and HCM. Methods Sixty patients with 3 LGE etiologies (AMI, n = 20; CMI, n = 20; HCM, n = 20) were scanned for LGE. LGE volume was quantified using the 7 techniques. Mean LGE volume, interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility, and impact on sample size were assessed. Results LGE volume varied significantly with the quantification method used. There was no statistically significant difference between LGE volume by the FWHM, manual, and 6-SD or 5-SD techniques. The 2-SD technique generated LGE volumes up to 2 times higher than the FWHM, 6-SD, and manual techniques. The reproducibility of all techniques was worse in HCM than AMI or CMI. The FWHM technique was the most reproducible in all 3 conditions compared with any other method (p < 0.001). Use of the FWHM technique for LGE quantification in paired analysis would lead to at least a 60% reduction in required sample size compared with any other method. Conclusions Regardless of the disease under study, the FWHM technique for LGE quantification gives LGE volume mean results similar to manual quantification and is statistically the most reproducible, reducing required sample sizes by up to one-half. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.","cardiac magnetic resonance; cardiomyopathy; imaging; myocardial infarction; SVCs","gadoterate meglumine; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; article; cardiac imaging; contrast enhancement; controlled study; female; heart volume; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; major clinical study; male; myocardial disease; myocardial scar; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; reproducibility; sample size; Adult; Aged; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Cicatrix; Contrast Media; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; London; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Meglumine; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardium; Observer Variation; Organometallic Compounds; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies","Moon, J.

Materials and Methods 22 healthy volunteers (1:1 M:F, 26-64 years) underwent MRI during rest and the MIST. Real-time spiral phase contrast MR, accelerated with sensitivity encoding (SENSE) was used to assess stroke volume (SV), and radial k-t SENSE was used to assess ventricular volumes. Simultaneous heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) measures allowed calculation of cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and arterial compliance (TAC). Endocrine responses were assessed using salivary cortisol. Results In response to stress, BP increased due to increased CO and reduced TAC but not increased SVR, which fell. HR, not SV, determined CO increases. Greater BP responses occurred in men due to greater CO increases and relatively higher SVR. Older participants had greater BP responses due to greater falls in TAC. Greater cortisol response was correlated with greater falls in TAC but resting cortisol and TAC were not related. Conclusion This new approach allows detailed, accurate assessment of stress physiology. Preliminary findings suggest stress exposes relationships, not seen at rest, of cardiovascular function with age, sex, and endocrine function.

Materials and Methods Real-time phase contrast images were acquired to measure flow and stroke volumes in 10 subjects, during free breathing, at rest, and during exercise. A nonrigid registration algorithm was developed to propagate a manually drawn region of interest in the aorta from one frame to all other frames of the real-time sequence (148 images). Thus the technique provided a semi-automatic segmentation over the whole sequence of images. The accuracy was assessed by comparison with manual segmentations in terms of Dice overlap measures and stroke volumes (SV). Results Semi-automatic segmentations were comparable to manual ones (Dice score of 0.89 ± 0.04). Inter-observer reproducibility was similar for manual and semi-automatic segmentations (Dice score of 0.90 ± 0.04 in both cases, the difference was not significant). SV measurements also showed good agreement between manual and semi-automatic segmentations (correlation coefficient r > 0.94), and the differences were not statistically significant.

The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of MRI and CT assessment of great vessel stents in an in vitro model. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three contemporary great vessel stent materials (nitinol, platinum-iridium, and stainless steel) were assessed with three luminal conditions: no stenosis, internal stenosis, and external stenosis. Stents of the same material were implanted into an aorta model that was attached to an animal bypass pump with pulsatile flow. Each stent was imaged with conventional angiography as reference standard, 10 different MRI sequences, and CT. The sensitivity and specificity for the identification of stent stenosis was determined and stent lumen measurements compared. RESULTS. Of the investigated MRI sequences, three had the highest overall sensitivity and specificity for the identification of stent stenosis in all studied materials: through-plane gradient-recalled echo (GRE) with 75° flip angle (100% and 95%, respectively), in- and through-plane steady-state free precession (SSFP) (99% and 90%) and MR angiography (MRA) with 75° flip angle (93% and 85%). Comparable sensitivity and specificity were achieved with CT (98% and 93%). GRE, SSFP, and MRA sequences tended to underestimate stent lumen diameter in externally nonstenosed stents and overestimate diameter in internally stenosed stents (p < 0.05). CT slightly underestimated external stenoses in all stent types (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION. Defined MRI sequences are feasible to assess nitinol, platinum-iridium, and stainless steel great vessel stents with diagnostic performance comparable with CT. © American Roentgen Ray Society.","Conventional angiography; Dual-source CT; Great vessel stent imaging; MRI; Surveillance of stent patency","iohexol; iridium; nitinol; platinum; stainless steel; animal experiment; animal model; aorta; aorta stenosis; artery bypass; article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; conventional angiography; coronary stent; diagnostic accuracy; great blood vessel; in vitro study; magnetic resonance angiography; non invasive procedure; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; pulsatile flow; sensitivity and specificity; steady state; Angiography; Animals; Aorta; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stents; Swine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Taylor, A.

Although, echocardiography is the most commonly used imaging modality for diagnosis and follow up of subjects with CHD, the evolution of both cardiovascular magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) does offer new ways to visualise the heart and great vessels. Cardiovascular MR techniques such as spin-echo and gradient-echo imaging, velocity-encoded phase-contrast MR and gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography allow comprehensive assessment of cardiac anatomy and function. This provides information about the long-term sequelae of the underlying anatomy, haemodynamic assessment of residual post-operative lesions and complications of surgery. Similarly, the development of spiral and subsequently multi-detector CT enables the acquisition of data during a single breath-hold and during the first pass of a contrast bolus, so that images can be reconstructed in any two-dimensional plane or in three-dimensions. As much of the functional data in CHD patients was traditionally acquired with invasive X-ray angiography, non-invasive alternatives such as cardiovascular MR and CT are desirable. This review evaluates the role of imaging modalities in the management of subjects with CHD, particularly detailing recent developments in imaging techniques as they relate to the various CHD diagnoses commonly encountered in practice. © 2010.","Adult congenital heart disease; Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Computed tomography","gadolinium; aorta coarctation; aorta valve stenosis; article; computer assisted tomography; congenital heart disease; contrast enhancement; coronary artery anomaly; coronary artery obstruction; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic value; echocardiography; Fallot tetralogy; general anesthesia; great vessels transposition; heart atrium septum defect; heart catheterization; heart muscle ischemia; heart right ventricle outflow tract obstruction; heart ventricle septum defect; human; image reconstruction; lung vascular resistance; magnetic resonance angiography; multidetector computed tomography; nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prognosis; pulmonary valve atresia; sudden death; Australia; Coronary Vessels; Gadolinium; Heart Defects, Congenital; Hemodynamics; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Pulmonary Atresia; Tetralogy of Fallot; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Transposition of Great Vessels","Puranik, R.; Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Unit, United Kingdom; email: rpuranik@mail.usyd.edu.au",,,14439506,,HLCEA,"20181524","English","Heart Lung Circul.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649238203

The pathophysiologic consequences of RVOT interventions and the subsequent change in exercise performance are still poorly understood. We sought to assess the effect of percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) on exercise capacity in (1) patients with predominantly pulmonary stenosis (PS) and (2) in patients with predominantly pulmonary regurgitation (PR). A total of 63 patients with either predominantly PS (n = 37) or PR (n = 26) underwent PPVI. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and magnetic resonance imaging were performed before and within 1 month after PPVI. On magnetic resonance imaging, the at rest effective biventricular stroke volumes improved in both groups after PPVI (p &lt;0.001), but the ejection fraction improved only in the PS group. In the PS group, exercise capacity (peak oxygen uptake, p &lt;0.001), ventilatory efficiency (p &lt;0.001), and peak oxygen pulse (p &lt;0.001) improved after PPVI. In the PR group, none of these parameters changed after PPVI (p = 0.6, p = 0.12, and p = 0.9, respectively). On multivariate analysis, the reduction in RVOT gradient was the only predictor of improved peak oxygen uptake when assessed in the whole patient group (rpart = -0.59; p &lt;0.001) or in the PS (rpart = -0.45; p = 0.002) or PR groups alone (rpart = -0.45; p = 0.02). In conclusion, acutely after PPVI, exercise capacity improves with the relief of stenosis but not regurgitation. A reduction in the RVOT gradient, even small gradients, was the only independent predictor of improved peak oxygen uptake in both patient groups, irrespective of improved pulmonary valve competence. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Setting: Single centre paediatric and adult congenital heart disease unit. Patients: 45 subjects (24.6 years, range 16.9-52.2 years) who underwent the Ross procedure between 1994 and 2006 (8.1 years after the Ross operation, range 2.0-14.0 years). Interventions: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Main outcome measures: Autograft and homograft stenosis, and regurgitation. Autograft size. Biventricular function, scar volume and exercise capacity. Results: Mean autograft regurgitation was 6.8%±8.3% (trivial regurgitation) and diameter was 40.0±7.0 mm. Mean homograft velocity was 2.4±0.6 m/s (mild-moderate stenosis) and regurgitation was 6.1%±8.3% (trivial regurgitation). Biventricular systolic function was normal (LV EF 63.1±6.4% and RV EF 60.1%±7.6%). In 38% of cases there was evidence of LV scar, mostly noted within the inter-ventricular septum. The mean exercise capacity achieved was 87%±22% of predicted. There was no correlation between exercise capacity and ventricular function or scar. Conclusion: This study demonstrates minor autograft and homograft dysfunction in the majority of patients after the Ross procedure, associated with good ventricular function and exercise capacity.

In this article, we propose a split-acquisition real-time CINE PCMR technique, where the acquisition of flow-encoded and flow-compensated data is divided into separate blocks. By comparing magnitude images, automatic matching of data in cardio-respiratory space allows subtraction of background phase offsets. Thus, the data is acquired in real-time but with phase correction originating from a different heart beat. This effectively doubles the frame rate, allowing either higher temporal or spatial resolution. Two split-acquisition sequences were tested: one with high-temporal resolution and one with high-spatial resolution. Both sequences showed excellent agreement in stroke volumes in 20 adults when validated against cardiac-gated PCMR and interleaved real-time PCMR (cardiac gated: 95.2 ± 20.0 mL, interleaved real-time: 96.2 ± 20.7 mL, high-temporal resolution: 95.6 ± 20.1 mL, high-spatial resolution: 95.5 ± 20.4 mL). In six children, the high-spatial resolution sequence provided more accurate flow measurements than interleaved real-time PCMR, when compared with cardiac-gated PCMR (cardiac gated: 20.6 ± 7.6 mL, interleaved real-time: 24.3 ± 9.2 mL, high-spatial resolution: 20.8 ± 7.8 mL), due to the increased spatial resolution. The matching technique is shown to be accurate (truth: 94.6 ± 21.8, split-acquisition: 95.0 ± 21.9 mL) and quantitative image quality (signal-to-noise ratio, velocity-to-noise ratio and edge sharpness) is acceptable. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","flow quantification; phase-contrast; real-time imaging","Flow measurement; Heart; Magnetic resonance; Signal to noise ratio; Flow quantification; High spatial resolution; High temporal resolution; Phase contrasts; Phase-contrast magnetic resonances; Quantitative images; Realtime imaging; Temporal and spatial; Image resolution; adolescent; adult; article; blood flow; child; clinical article; congenital heart disease; heart cycle; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic parameters; human; image quality; imaging system; infant; intermethod comparison; measurement; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; phase contrast nuclear magnetic resonance; real time nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; time","Muthurangu, V.; Cardiovascular Unit, Great Ormond St., London WC1N 3JH, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ich.ucl.ac.uk",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc",07403194,,MRMEE,"20939086","English","Magn.

The sequence was validated at rest against a vendor supplied gated PC sequence, and also at rest and during exercise against left ventricular volumes assessed using a radial k-t SENSE real-time sequence. Combining the measured flow volumes with simultaneous oscillometric blood pressure measurements, enabled the noninvasive calculations of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and arterial compliance (C). Results: Measured flow volumes correlated very well between the sequences at rest and during exercise. Cardiac output (CO) and heart rate were found to significantly increase during exercise, while SVR and C were found to decrease significantly. Conclusion: Hemodynamic response to exercise can be accurately quantified using a high temporal resolution spiral SENSE real-time flow imaging. This may allow early detection of hypertension and a greater understanding of the early changes in this condition. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cardiovascular imaging; Exercise; Real-time imaging","adult; artery compliance; article; ascending aorta; blood pressure measurement; blood vessel reactivity; calculation; ergometer; exercise; female; heart left ventricle; heart output; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; lung flow volume curve; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oscillometry; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; rest; supine position; validation study; vascular resistance; aorta; artifact; blood flow velocity; blood pressure; image quality; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; time; Adult; Aorta; Artifacts; Blood Flow Velocity; Blood Pressure; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors","Muthurangu, V.; Cardiovascular Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond St., London WC1N 3JH, United Kingdom; email: v.muthurangu@ich.ucl.ac.uk",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",10531807,,JMRIF,"20373446","English","J.

Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation led to a reduction in RV to LV mechanical delay (127.9 ± 50.9 vs. 37.7 ± 35.6 ms; P &lt; 0.001) and less LV septal bowing in early LV diastole (septal curvature: -0.11 ± 0.11 vs. 0.07 ± 0.13 cm-1; P &lt; 0.001). Early LV diastolic filling (first one-third of diastole) increased significantly (17.5 ± 9.4 to 30.4 ± 9.4 mL/m2; P &lt; 0.001). The increase in early LV diastolic filling correlated with the reduction in RV to LV mechanical delay (r = -0.68; P = 0.001) and change in septal curvature (r = 0.71; P &lt; 0.001). In addition, the improvement in peak oxygen uptake (56.0 ± 16.0 vs. 64.1 ± 13.7 of predicted; P &lt; 0.001) was associated with the increase in early LV diastolic filling (r = 0.69; P = 0.001).ConclusionRelief of RV to PA conduit obstruction significantly improves early LV filling properties. This is attributed to more favourable septal motion and reduction in interventricular mechanical delay.","Congenital heart disease; Interventricular mechanical delay; Right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit; Septal motion; Ventricular interaction","adolescent; adult; article; child; clinical article; clinical trial; congenital heart disease; diastolic blood pressure; female; heart left ventricle filling pressure; heart left ventricle volume; heart right ventricle pressure; heart ventricle enddiastolic pressure; heart ventricle septum; human; lung artery pressure; male; percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation; priority journal; pulmonary valve replacement; right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit; school child; systolic blood pressure; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Blood Pressure; Blood Vessel Prosthesis; Child; Echocardiography; Female; Graft Occlusion, Vascular; Heart Septum; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Artery; Pulmonary Valve; Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency; Pulmonary Valve Stenosis; Stress, Mechanical; Young Adult","Lurz, P.; Cardiac Unit, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, United Kingdom; email: philipp.lurz@gmx.de",,,0195668X,,EHJOD,"19561027","English","Eur.

In this study, we assessed the acute physiological effects of BMS versus percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) using an x-ray/magnetic resonance hybrid laboratory. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fourteen consecutive children (median age, 12.9 years) with significant right ventricular outflow tract obstruction underwent BMS followed by PPVI. Magnetic resonance imaging (ventricular volumes and function and great vessel blood flow) and hemodynamic assessment (invasive pressure measurements) were performed before BMS, after BMS, and after PPVI; all were performed under general anesthesia in an x-ray/magnetic resonance hybrid laboratory. BMS significantly reduced the ratio of right ventricular to systemic pressure (0.75±0.17% versus 0.41±0.14%; P<0.001) with no further change after PPVI (0.42plusmn;0.11; P≤1.0). However, BMS resulted in free pulmonary regurgitation (21.3±10.7% versus 41.4±7.5%; P<0.001), which was nearly abolished after PPVI (3.6±5.6%; P<0.001). Effective right ventricular stroke volume (right ventricular stroke volume minus pulmonary regurgitant volume) after BMS remained unchanged (33.8±7.3 versus 32.6±8.7 mL/m; P≤1.0) but was significantly increased after revalvulation with PPVI (41.0±8.0 mL/m; P≤0.004). These improvements after PPVI were accompanied by a significant heart rate reduction (75.5±17.7 bpm after BMS versus 69.0±16.9 bpm after PPVI; P≤0.006) at maintained cardiac output (2.5±0.5 versus 2.4±0.5 versus 2.7±0.5 mL• min • m; P≤0.14). CONCLUSION: Using an x-ray/magnetic resonance hybrid laboratory, we have demonstrated the superior acute hemodynamic effects of PPVI over BMS in patients with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. © 2009 American Heart Association.","Heart valve prosthesis implantation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pediatrics; Stents; Ventricular outflow obstruction","adolescent; adult; article; bare metal stent; child; clinical article; controlled study; female; heart rate; heart right ventricle outflow tract obstruction; hemodynamics; human; implantation; intermethod comparison; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation; priority journal; school child; stroke; X ray; Adolescent; Cardiac Volume; Child; Female; Fluoroscopy; Heart Catheterization; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Metals; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Valve; Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency; Stents; Ventricular Dysfunction, Right; Ventricular Outflow Obstruction; Ventricular Pressure","Taylor, A.

Agreement in RV and LV SV during exercise was better with radial k-t real-time (SD of difference ±3.43 vs. ±8.97 mL; P < 0.001). Agreement in cardiac output (CO) in the same subject at two different im- aging sessions was better for radial k-t SENSE.

Materials and Methods: The local research ethics committee approved this study, and written consent was obtained from all participants. Of 40 patients with congenital heart disease, ventricular volumes were measured by using the three sequences. Global image quality and motion fidelity were scored and compared with a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Image contrast, edge sharpness, and summed perimeters (the total length of the endocardial tracings for a given ventricle at systole and diastole) were quantified and compared by using paired t tests. Ventricular volumes were compared with paired t tests, Bland-Altman analysis, and correlation coefficients. Results: Global image quality, motion fidelity, image contrast, edge sharpness, and summed perimeters were all greater for radial real-time k-t SENSE imaging compared with standard real-time imaging (P < .05). However, the gated acquisitions were significantly superior to radial real-time k-t SENSE (P < .05). For cardiac gated versus radial k-t real-time acquisitions, there was no difference between right ventricular (RV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF) (P > .15). There was a small difference in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (EDV) and thus, LV stroke volume and EF (P < .05).

METHODS AND RESULTS - Between September 2000 and February 2007, 155 patients with stenosis and/or regurgitation underwent percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation. This led to significant reduction in right ventricular systolic pressure (from 63±18 to 45±13 mm Hg, P<0.001) and right ventricular outflow tract gradient (from 37±20 to 17±10 mm Hg, P<0.001). Follow-up ranged from 0 to 83.7 months (median 28.4 months). Freedom from reoperation was 93% (±2%), 86% (±3%), 84% (±4%), and 70% (±13%) at 10, 30, 50, and 70 months, respectively. Freedom from transcatheter reintervention was 95% (±2%), 87% (±3%), 73% (±6%), and 73% (±6%) at 10, 30, 50, and 70 months, respectively. Survival at 83 months was 96.9%. On time-dependent analysis, the first series of 50 patients (log-rank test P<0.001) and patients with a residual gradient >25 mm Hg (log-rank test P=0.01) were associated with a higher risk of reoperations. CONCLUSIONS - Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation resulted in the ability to avoid surgical right ventricular outflow tract revision in the majority of cases. This procedure might reduce the number of operations needed over the total lifetime of patients with right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduits. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.","Catheterization; Heart defects, congenital; Pulmonary valve; Regurgitation; Stenosis","adolescent; adult; aged; article; follow up; heart right ventricle outflow tract; heart valve replacement; heart ventricle contraction; human; major clinical study; medical technology; priority journal; pulmonary valve insufficiency; pulmonary valve stenosis; reoperation; school child; survival; systolic blood pressure; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Catheterization; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Pulmonary Valve; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive; Tetralogy of Fallot; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Outflow Obstruction","Bonhoeffer, P.; Cardiac Unit, Great Ormond St, London WC1N 3JH, United Kingdom; email: BonhoP@gosh.nhs.uk",,,00097322,,CIRCA,"18391109","English","Circulation",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149189394

However, this technique requires cooperation from the patient, and in some cases the scan planning is complicated. Isotropic nonangulated three-dimensional (3D) cardiac MR can overcome some of these problems because it requires minimal planning and can be reformatted in any plane. However, current methods, even those that use undersampling techniques, involve breath-holding for periods that are too long for many patients. Free-breathing respiratory gating sequences represent a possible solution for realizing 3D cine imaging. A real-time respiratory self-gating technique for whole-heart cine MRI is presented. The technique enables assessment of cardiac anatomy and function with minimum planning or patient cooperation. Nonangulated isotropic 3D data were acquired from five healthy volunteers and then reformatted into 2D clinical views. The respiratory self-gating technique is shown to improve image quality in free-breathing scanning. In addition, ventricular volumetric data obtained using the 3D approach were comparable to those acquired with the conventional multislice 2D approach. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cine MRI; Free breathing; Respiratory gating; Self navigation; Whole-heart imaging","Heart; Image enhancement; Respiratory mechanics; Volumetric analysis; Cardiac anatomy; Cine-MRI; Free breathing; Healthy volunteers; Heart imaging; Respiratory gatings; Threedimensional (3-d); Two Dimensional (2 D); Magnetic resonance imaging; article; breath holding; controlled study; functional anatomy; heart scintiscanning; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; image quality; mathematical analysis; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; respiratory function; three dimensional imaging","Hill, D.L.G.; Center for Medical Image Computing, Malet Place, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; email: derek.hill@ucl.ac.uk",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",07403194,,MRMEE,"17326164","English","Magn.

The authors looked at the feasibility of using multiple tuned fiducial markers (TFM) and novel imaging sequences to track catheters reliably under MR and to evaluate the safety of such markers in terms of heating. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The visualization and tracking of a catheter with six quadrature tuned fiducial coils was carried out in a special designed in-vitro setup within a 1.5-T MR imager simulating an MR-guided endovascular intervention. The fiducial markers were also tested for heating. RESULTS: The excellent signal contrast between the fiducial and the background when using novel interleaved real time and interactive sequences allowed for rapid and reliable identification of the fiducial markers and therefore the catheter. No significant heating of the marker was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have shown that catheters with multiple tuned fiducial markers are superior to passive catheter designs in terms of visualization and do not carry the risk of heating that is commonly associated with active catheters. © SIR, 2006.",,"artery catheter; article; comparative study; computer simulation; contrast enhancement; evaluation; guide wire; heart catheterization; heating; image analysis; image quality; in vitro study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phantom; priority journal; reliability; Feasibility Studies; Heart Catheterization; Heat; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Phantoms, Imaging","Razavi, R.S.; Division of Imaging Sciences, , London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom; email: reza.razavi@kcl.ac.uk",,,10510443,,JVIRE,"16868171","English","J.

In this study, we describe the results of 37 patients who underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (MR) assessment before BCPC. Methods and Results - Cardiovascular MR and echocardiography were performed in 37 infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome before BCPC, and the findings were compared with surgical findings. MR assessment of ventricular function and valvar regurgitation were compared with echocardiography. MR exhibited high sensitivity and specificity for identification of neoaortic (sensitivity 86%, specificity 97%) and left pulmonary artery (sensitivity 100%, specificity 94%) obstruction. Echocardiography exhibited poor sensitivity for identification of vascular stenosis. The mean right ventricular ejection fraction calculated from the MR data was 50±10%. There was general agreement between MR and echocardiographic measures of ventricular function, although patients with good function on echocardiography demonstrated a wide range of ejection fractions. There was good agreement between MR and echocardiography for identification of valvar regurgitation. Conclusions - Cardiovascular MR can be used to define ventricular and valvar function and vascular anatomy in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome after the Norwood operation. We have shown how this information can be used to plan the BCPC and identify any revisions or additional valvar surgery. © 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.","Heart defects, congenital; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pediatrics; Surgery","article; clinical article; congenital heart malformation; echocardiography; female; heart catheterization; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart valve regurgitation; heart ventricle function; high risk infant; human; hypoplastic left heart syndrome; infant; male; Norwood procedure; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pediatrics; priority journal; risk assessment; aorta; aorta disease; clinical trial; comparative study; echography; heart stroke volume; heart surgery; heart valve; hypoplastic left heart syndrome; methodology; newborn; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; physiology; prediction and forecasting; pulmonary artery; reoperation; sensitivity and specificity; valvular heart disease; diagnostic agent; gadolinium; Aorta; Aortic Diseases; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Echocardiography; Gadolinium; Heart Valve Diseases; Heart Valves; Humans; Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulmonary Artery; Reoperation; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stroke Volume","Razavi, R.; Division of Imaging Sciences, , London, SE1 9RT, United Kingdom; email: reza.razavi@kcl.ac.uk",,,00097322,,CIRCA,"16301358","English","Circulation",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644877819

Pulmonary total arterial compliance is also an indicator of pulmonary hypertensive disease. However, because of difficulties in measuring compliance, it is rarely used. We describe a method of measuring pulmonary arterial compliance utilizing magnetic resonance (MR) flow data and invasive pressure measurements. Seventeen patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension or congenital heart disease requiring preoperative assessment underwent MR-guided cardiac catheterization. Invasive manometry was used to measure pulmonary arterial pressure, and phase-contrast MR was used to measure flow at baseline and at 20 ppm nitric oxide (NO). Total arterial compliance was calculated using the pulse pressure method (parameter optimization of the 2-element Windkessel model) and the ratio of stroke volume to pulse pressure. There was good agreement between the two estimates of compliance (r = 0.98, P < 0.001). However, there was a systematic bias between the ratio of stroke volume to pulse pressure and the pulse pressure method (bias = 61%, upper level of agreement = 84%, lower level of agreement = 38%). In response to 20 ppm NO, there was a statistically significant fall in resistance, systolic pressure, and pulse pressure. In seven patients, total arterial compliance increased > 10% in response to 20 ppm NO. As a population, the increase did not reach statistical significance. There was an inverse relation between compliance and resistance (r = 0.89, P < 0.001) and between compliance and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). We have demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying total arterial compliance using an MR method.

The right ventricular (RV) pressure (64.4±17.2 to 50.4±14 mm Hg, P&lt;0.001), RVOT gradient (33±24.6 to 19.5±15.3, P&lt;0.001), and pulmonary regurgitation (PR) (grade 2 of greater before, none greater than grade 2 after, P&lt;0.001) decreased significantly after PPVI. MRI showed significant reduction in PR fraction (21±13% versus 3±4%, P&lt;0.001) and in RV end-diastolic volume (EDV) (94±28 versus 82±24 mL · beat-1 · m-1, P&lt;0.001) and a significant increase in left ventricular EDV (64±12 versus 71±13 mL · beat-1 · m-2, P=0.005) and effective RV stroke volume (37±7 versus 42±9 mL · beat-1 · m-2, P=0.006) in 28 patients (age 19±8 years). A further 16 subjects, on metabolic exercise testing, showed significant improvement in Vo2max (26±7 versus 29±6 mL · kg-1 · min-1, P&lt;0.001). There was no mortality. Conclusions - PPVI is feasible at low risk, with quantifiable improvement in MRI-defined ventricular parameters and pulmonary regurgitation, and results in subjective and objective improvement in exercise capacity. © 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.","Catheterization; Exercise testing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pulmonary valve insufficiency; Regurgitation","adolescent; adult; article; child; cineradiography; congenital heart disease; device; device infection; echocardiography; endocarditis; exercise test; Fallot tetralogy; female; follow up; great vessels transposition; heart catheterization; heart right ventricle outflow tract obstruction; heart ventricle volume; human; implantation; major clinical study; male; mortality; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; pulmonary valve disease; pulmonary valve insufficiency; treatment outcome; valvular heart disease; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Pressure; Child; Coronary Angiography; Echocardiography; Exercise; Exercise Test; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Catheterization; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prosthesis Failure; Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency; Stents; Treatment Outcome","Khambadkone, S.; Great Ormond Street Hospital, London WC1N 3JH, United Kingdom; email: khambs@gosh.nhs.uk",,,00097322,,CIRCA,"16103239","English","Circulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24044459734

In both cases, cardiac transplantation was considered, but right ventricular function improved without invasive management.

The Fick principle, used to quantify pulmonary artery flow, may be a flawed technique. We describe a novel method of PVR quantification by the use of magnetic resonance (MR) flow data and invasive pressure measurements. Methods and Results-In 24 patients with either suspected pulmonary hypertension or congenital heart disease requiring preoperative assessment, PVR was calculated by the use of simultaneously acquired MR flow and invasive pressure measurements (condition 1). In 19 of the 24 patients, PVR was also calculated at 20 ppm nitric oxide +30% (condition 2) and at 20 ppm nitric oxide +100% oxygen (condition 3), with the use of the MR method. This method proved safe and feasible in all patients. In 15 of 19 patients, PVR calculated by Fick flow was compared with the MR method. At condition 1, Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias of 2.3% (MR > Fick) and limits of agreement of 50.2% to -45.5%. At condition 2, there was poorer agreement (bias was 28%, and the limits of agreement were 151.3% to 95.2%). At condition 3, there was very poor agreement (bias was 54.2%, and the limits of agreement were 174.4% to -66.0%). Conclusions-We have demonstrated the feasibility of using simultaneous invasive pressure measurements and MR flow data to measure PVR in humans.","Catheterization; Magnetic resonance imaging; Vasculature","nitric oxide; adolescent; adult; artery blood flow; article; clinical article; congenital heart disease; contrast enhancement; human; infant; lung vascular resistance; nuclear magnetic resonance; preoperative evaluation; preschool child; priority journal; pulmonary artery; pulmonary hypertension; quantitative analysis; school child; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Feasibility Studies; Female; Fluoroscopy; Heart Catheterization; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Pulmonary Circulation; Radiation Dosage; Reproducibility of Results; Rheology; Sensitivity and Specificity; Vascular Resistance","Razavi, R.S.; Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom; email: reza.razavi@kcl.ac.uk",,,00097322,,CIRCA,"15302793","English","Circulation",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143126401

Drawbacks include poor soft tissue visualisation and exposure to radiation. We describe the first 16 cases of a novel method of cardiac catheterisation guided by MRI with radiographic support. Methods: In our cardiac catheterisation laboratory, we combine magnetic resonance and radiographic imaging facilities. We used MRI to measure flow and morphology, and real-time MRI sequences to visualise balloon angiographic catheters. 12 patients underwent diagnostic cardiac catheterisation, two had interventional cardiac catheteri sations, and for two patients, MRI was used to plan radiofrequency ablation for treatment of tachyarrhythmias. Findings: In 14 patients, some or all of the cardiac catheterisation was guided by MRI. In two patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation, catheters were manipulated with use of fluoroscopic guidance and outcome was assessed with MRI. All patients received lower amounts of radiation than controls. There was some discrepancy between pulmonary vascular resistance calculated by flow derived from MRI and the traditional Fick method. We were able to superimpose fluoroscopic images of electro physiology electrode catheters on the three dimensional MRI of the cardiac anatomy. Interpretation: We have shown that cardiac catheterisation guided by MRI is safe and practical in a clinical setting, allows better soft tissue visualisation, provides more pertinent physiological information, and results in lower radiation exposure than do fluoroscopically guided procedures. MRI guidance could become the method of choice for diagnostic cardiac catheterisation in patients with congenital heart disease, and an important tool in interventional cardiac catheterisation and radiofrequency ablation.",,"adolescent; adult; age distribution; angiocardiography; article; balloon catheter; calculation; catheter ablation; child; clinical article; congenital heart disease; controlled study; diagnostic procedure; electrode; electrophysiology; female; fluoroscopy; heart catheterization; human; imaging system; laboratory; lung vascular resistance; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; radiation; radiocardiography; radiofrequency; tachycardia","Razavi, R.; Division of Imaging Science, , London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom; email: reza.razavi@kcl.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",01406736,,LANCA,"14667742","English","Lancet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10744224950

Using a steady state free precession gradient echo technique and parallel imaging, rapid acquisition of the entire cardiac volume is possible during 8 to 15 sequential breath-holds, each lasting between 8 and 15 s. We obtained high-resolution images, with a resolution of 1 mm3, at between 3 and 10 phases of the cardiac cycle. While images of diagnostic quality were obtained in all cases, in 52 patients there was some degradation due to various factors. Children under 8 years were ventilated, and ventilation was suspended for the breath-holds. For patients breathing spontaneously a novel respiratory navigator technique was developed, using a navigator echo placed over the right hemidiaphragm. This was used successfully in 20 patients, and reduced the misalignment of images obtained during different breath-holds. Images were analysed using multi-planar reformatting and volume rendering. Image processing took approximately five minutes for each study. End-diastolic images were processed for all patients. Systolic images were also processed in selected cases. Further improvements in parallel imaging should reduce imaging times further, so that it is possible to obtain the full volume image in a single breath-hold. This will enable imaging of complex anatomy to be obtained using a standard imaging protocol that does not require the operator to understand the cardiac malformation, making the magnetic resonance imaging of congenital cardiac disease faster and more effective. © Greenwich Medical Media Ltd.","Cardiac anomalies; Cardiology; Magnetic resonance imaging","gadolinium; adolescent; adult; aged; article; breath holding; child; congenital heart malformation; contrast enhancement; diagnostic accuracy; echo planar imaging; heart cycle; heart volume; hemidiaphragm; human; image analysis; image processing; image quality; infant; major clinical study; morphology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; three dimensional imaging; congenital heart malformation; methodology; middle aged; newborn; pathology; preschool child; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged","Razavi, R.S.; MRI, Guy's Tower, London SE1 9RT, United Kingdom; email: resa.razavi@kcl.ac.uk",,,10479511,,CYAOB,"14694941","English","Cardiol.
